TI Thinking Well: A randomised controlled feasibility study of a new CBT

AB Background and objectives: Delusional beliefs with persecutory content are common in psychosis, but difficult to treat. Interventions targeting hypothesised causal and maintaining factors have been proposed as a way of improving therapy. The current study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial of the 'Thinking Well (TW)' intervention: This novel approach combines the recently developed Maudsley Review Training Programme (MRTP), with additional, focussed cognitive-behavioural therapy sessions.
   Methods: 31 participants with distressing persecutory delusions and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were randomised to TW or to treatment as usual in a 2:1 ratio. Participants completed outcome assessments at 0 (baseline), 1 (post-MRTP), 6 (post-TW) and 8 (follow-up) weeks. Key outcomes included belief flexibility, paranoia, and delusional conviction and distress. Participants allocated to TW completed the MRTP package and four CBT sessions with a clinical psychologist.
   Results: Recruitment proved feasible. Participants reported the intervention was relevant and had resulted in positive changes in thinking and mood, which they could use in everyday life. Treatment effects were moderate-large for key outcomes including belief flexibility, paranoia conviction and distress. The additional TW sessions appeared to confer benefits over MRTP alone.
   Limitations: Assessments were not carried out blind to treatment condition. Recruitment was opportunistic, from an identified pool of research participants. Finally, a few participants had already completed the MRTP as part of a previous study.
   Conclusions: The TW intervention appears to be feasible and acceptable to participants, and the effects of treatment are promising. A fully powered randomised controlled trial of the intervention is warranted. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Persecutory delusions are a central psychotic experience, at the severe end of a paranoia spectrum in the general population. The aim of the review is to provide an introduction to the understanding of persecutory delusions, highlight key putative causal factors that have the potential to be translated into efficacious treatment, and indicate future research directions.
   A narrative literature review was undertaken to highlight the main recent areas of empirical study concerning non-clinical and clinical paranoia.
   Six main proximal causal factors are identified: a worry thinking style, negative beliefs about the self, interpersonal sensitivity, sleep disturbance, anomalous internal experience, and reasoning biases. Each has plausible mechanistic links to the occurrence of paranoia. These causal factors may be influenced by a number of social circumstances, including adverse events, illicit drug use, and urban environments.
   There have been numerous replicated empirical findings leading to a significant advance in the understanding of persecutory delusions, now beginning to be translated into cognitive treatments. The first trials specifically focussed on patients who have persecutory delusions in the context of psychotic diagnoses are occurring. Initial evidence of efficacy is very promising.

AB Background: Suicide behaviour in psychosis is a significant clinical and social problem. There is a dearth of evidence for psychological interventions designed to reduce suicide risk in this population.
   Aims: To evaluate a novel, manualised, cognitive behavioural treatment protocol (CBSPp) based upon an empirically validated theoretical model.
   Methods: A randomly controlled trial with independent and masked allocated and assessment of CBSPp with TAU (n = 25, 24 sessions) compared to TAU alone (n = 24) using standardised assessments. Measures of suicide probability, and suicidal ideation were the primary outcomes and measures of hopelessness, depression, psychotic symptoms, functioning, and self-esteem were the secondary outcomes, assessed at 4 and 6 months follow-up.
   Results: The CBSPp group improved differentially to the TAU group on two out of three primary outcome measures of suicidal ideation and suicide probability, and on secondary outcomes of hopelessness related to suicide probability, depression, some psychotic symptoms and self-esteem.
   Conclusions: CBSPp is a feasible intervention which has the potential to reduce proxy measures of suicide in psychotic patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is currently a recommended form of psychosocial treatment for persons suffering from persistent psychotic symptoms. It has been argued that effect sizes from efficacy studies cannot be generalized to real clinical settings. Aims: Our aim was to evaluate whether the positive results from randomized controlled trials conducted by experts could be replicated in clinical setting with a heterogeneous sample of patients with psychotic disorder. Method: Patients referred to the study were either randomized to CBTp + TAU (the treatment group) or to a waiting-list group, only receiving TAU. The patients were assessed on different outcome measures such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS), at pretreatment, at posttreatment (6 months), and at 12 months follow-up. In total, 45 patients participated in the study. Results: The results showed that 20 sessions of CBTp performed significantly better than the waiting list controls with respect to the global score on the BPRS, the delusional scale on the PSYRATS, and the GAF symptom score at posttreatment. At 12 months follow-up only the GAF symptom score remained significantly changed for the total sample. Conclusions: The study revealed that CBTp delivered by non-experts in routine clinical settings can produce improvements in positive psychotic symptoms, and also that some of these improvements can be maintained at one year follow-up.

AB Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended in treatment guidelines for psychotic symptoms (NICE, 2009) but clients from some minority groups have been shown to have higher dropout rates and poorer outcomes. A recent qualitative study in ethnic minority groups concluded that CBT would be acceptable and may be more effective if it was culturally adapted to meet their needs (Rathod et al., 2010).
   Aim: This study assessed the effectiveness of a culturally adapted CBT for psychosis (CaCBTp) in Black British, African Caribbean/Black African and South Asian Muslim participants.
   Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in two centres in the UK (n=35) in participants with a diagnosis of a disorder from the schizophrenia group. Assessments were conducted at three time points: baseline, post-therapy and at 6 months follow-up, using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and Insight Scale. Outcomes on specific subscales of CPRS were also evaluated. Participants in the treatment arm completed the Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) to measure satisfaction with therapy. Assessors blind to randomisation and treatment allocation conducted administration of outcome measures. In total, n=33 participants were randomly allocated to CaCBTp arm (n=16) and treatment as usual (TAU) arm (n=17) after (n=2) participants were excluded. CaCBTp participants were offered 16 sessions of CaCBTp with trained therapists and the TAU arm continued with their standard treatment.
   Results: Analysis was based on the principles of intention to treat (ITT). This was further supplemented with secondary sensitivity analyses. Post-treatment, the intervention group showed statistically significant reductions in symptomatology on overall CPRS scores, CaCBTp Mean (SD)=16.23 (10.77), TAU=18.60 (14.84); p=0.047, with a difference in change of 11.31 (95% CI:0. 14 to 22.49); Schizophrenia change: CaCBTp=3.46 (3.37); TAU=4.78 (5.33) diff 4.62 (95% CI: 0.68 to 9.17); p=0.047 and positive symptoms (delusions; p=0.035, and hallucinations; p=0.056). At 6 months follow-up, MADRAS change=5.6 (95% CI: 2.92 to 7.60); p<0.001. Adjustment was made for age, gender and antipsychotic medication. Overall satisfaction was significantly correlated with the number of sessions attended (r=0.563; p=0.003).
   Conclusion: Participants in the CaCBTp group achieved statistically significant results post-treatment compared to those in the TAU group with some gains maintained at follow-up. High levels of satisfaction with the CaCBTp were reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Randomized controlled trials have attested the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing psychotic symptoms. Now, studies are needed to investigate its effectiveness in routine clinical practice settings. Method: Eighty patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who were seeking outpatient treatment were randomized to a specialized cognitive behavioral intervention for psychosis (CBTp; n = 40) or a wait list (n = 40). The CBTp group was assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. The wait list group was assessed at baseline, after a 4-month waiting period, at posttreatment, and after 1 year. The primary outcome measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: The CBTp group showed significant improvement over the wait list group for the total PANSS score at posttreatment postwaiting. CBTp was also superior to the wait list group in regard to the secondary outcomes positive symptoms, general psychopathology, depression, and functioning, but not in regard to negative symptoms. The number of dropouts during the treatment phases was low (11.3%). Participants perceived the treatment as helpful (98%) and considered themselves improved (92%). Significant pre- and posttreatment effect sizes varied between 0.77 for general psychopathology and 0.38 for delusional conviction. The positive effects of treatment could be maintained at 1-year follow-up, although the number of patients who had deteriorated was higher than at postassessment. Conclusions: Large proportions of patients in clinical practice settings benefit from CBTp. The efficacy of CBTp can be generalized to clinical practice despite the differences in patients, therapists, and deliverance.

ID RECOMMENDATIONS; SCALE
AB Objective: This study determined whether adding cognitive-behavioral therapy to treatment for outpatients with schizophrenia would be more effective than the use of second-generation antipsychotics alone. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either second-generation antipsychotics alone (N=18) or second-generation antipsychotics plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (N=15). Methods: All patients received pharmacotherapy from a single provider and in a predetermined standard manner. Psychopathology ratings were done at baseline, at the end of treatment (12 weeks) and three months after completion of treatment (24 weeks). Results: Twenty-five (76%) patients completed baseline and 12-week evaluations, and 17 (68%) patients who finished treatment also completed evaluations at 24 weeks. At the end of treatment persons in the second-generation antipsychotics plus cognitive- behavioral therapy group were rated as having less severe delusions than patients in the group receiving second-generation antipsychotics only, and this difference was maintained three months after treatment ended. Conclusions: Adding cognitive-behavioral therapy may help with reducing the severity of delusions among patients with schizophrenia. (Psychiatric Services 61: 940943, 2010)

It was predicted that a worry intervention would reduce levels of worry and paranoia distress. Twenty-four individuals with persistent persecutory delusions and high levels of worry were randomly assigned to receive a four session cognitive-behavioural worry intervention (W-CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). The worry intervention was specifically designed not to target the content of delusions. In this open-label evaluation, assessments of worry and paranoia were conducted at baseline, at one month (end of treatment) and at two months. The worry intervention achieved a statistically significant reduction in worry which was maintained at two month follow up. A significant reduction in delusional distress was also reported. There was an indication that the worry intervention may also reduce the frequency of paranoid thoughts but this was not statistically significant. In the first trial specifically for persecutory delusions, a brief worry intervention was shown to have benefits. The results support a causal role for worry in paranoid experience.

TI Cognitive-behavioural therapy v. social activity therapy for people with
   psychosis and a history of violence: randomised controlled trial
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHIZOPHRENIA; DELUSIONS; SCALES
AB Background
   Aggression and violence are serious problems in schizophrenia. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for psychosis although there have been no studies to date evaluating the impact of CBT for people with psychosis and a history of violence.
   Aims
   To investigate the effectiveness of CBT on violence, anger, psychosis and risk outcomes with people who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a history of violence.
   Method
   This was a single-blind randomised controlled trial of CBT v social activity therapy (SAT) with a primary outcome of violence and secondary outcomes of anger, symptoms, functioning and risk. outcomes were evaluated by masked assessors at 6 and 12 months (trial registration: NRR NO50087441).
   Results
   Significant benefits were shown for CBT compared with control over the intervention and follow-up period on violence, delusions and risk management.
   Conclusions
   Cognitive-behavioural therapy targeted at psychosis and anger may be an effective treatment for reducing the Occurrence of violence and further investigation of its benefits is warranted.

TI Cognitive-behavioural therapy and family intervention for relapse
   prevention and symptom reduction in psychosis: randomised controlled
   trial

DT Article

   THERAPY; 3-YEAR TRIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DELUSIONS; ILLNESS;
   HALLUCINATIONS; SCALES
AB Background
   Family intervention reduces relapse rates in psychosis. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) improves positive symptoms but effects on relapse rates are not established.
   Aims
   To test the effectiveness of CBT and family intervention in reducing relapse, and in improving symptoms and functioning in patients who had recently relapsed with non-affective psychosis.
   Method
   A multicentre randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN83557988) with two pathways: those without carers were allocated to treatment as usual or CBT plus treatment as usual, those with carers to treatment as usual, CBT plus treatment as usual or family intervention plus treatment as usual. The CBT and family intervention were focused on relapse prevention for 20 sessions over 9 months.
   Results
   A total of 301 patients and 83 carers participated. Primary outcome data were available on 96% of the total sample. The CBT and family intervention had no effects on rates of remission and relapse or on days in hospital at 12 or 24 months. For secondary outcomes, CBT showed a beneficial effect on depression at 24 months and there were no effects for family intervention. in people with carers, CBT significantly improved delusional distress and social functioning. Therapy did not change key psychological processes.
   Conclusions
   Generic CBT for psychosis is not indicated for routine relapse prevention in people recovering from a recent relapse of psychosis and should currently be reserved for those with distressing medication-unresponsive positive symptoms. Any CBT targeted at this acute population requires development. The lack of effect of family intervention on relapse may be attributable to the low overall relapse rate in those with carers.
