AB Web-based studies have become increasingly common in the social sciences, but have been rare in genetic epidemiology in general and twin studies in particular. We here review the methods, validity checks and preliminary correlational data from an on-line questionnaire collected from 2005-2008. During this time period, 44,112 individuals completed the questionnaire. This sample was 65.3% female, 85.4% 18 years or older, 72.0% Caucasian and had a mean educational level of 12.2 years. The sample included 609 twin, 333 sibling and 201 parent-offspring pairs as well as 342 dating partners, 313 1 significant other' pairs, 327 spouses and 2,316 friend pairs. A range of checks suggested low levels of invalid data. Correlations for personality, substance use and misuse, lifetime major depression, social attitudes, educational status, and height and weight were broadly similar to those obtained previously using conventional assessment methods. Web-based studies are a relatively easy and inexpensive way to ascertain large numbers of individuals, although obtaining twin pairs is more difficult, and female and monozygotic pairs are overrepresented. The sample is diverse and pair resemblance is generally similar to that obtained using interviews or mailed questionnaires.

AB In contrast with early theories of socialization that emphasized the role of parents in shaping their children's personalities, recent empirical evidence suggests an evocative relationship between adolescent personality traits and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship. Research using behavior genetic methods suggests that the association between personality and parenting is genetically mediated, such that the genetic effects on adolescent personality traits overlap with the genetic effects on parenting behavior. In the current study, the authors examined whether the etiology of this relationship might change depending on the adolescent's personality. Biometrical moderation models were used to test for gene-environment interaction and correlation between personality traits and measures of conflict, regard, and involvement with parents in a sample of 2,452 adolescents (M age = 17.79 years). They found significant moderation of both positive and negative qualities of the parent-adolescent relationship, such that the genetic and environmental variance in relationship quality varied as functions of the adolescent's levels of personality. These findings support the importance of adolescent personality in the development of the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship.

AB Four hundred and fifty six pairs of adult twins completed the Humor Styles Questionnaire - which measures two positive and two negative styles of humor - and the NEO-PI-R, which measures the Big-5 personality traits. Univariate behavioral genetic model-fitting revealed that individual differences in the two positive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) and all five of the Big-5 traits were largely attributable to genetic and nonshared environmental factors, whereas individual differences in the two negative humor styles (self-defeating and aggressive) were largely attributable to shared and nonshared environmental factors. Several significant phenotypic correlations were found between each of the four humor styles and the Big-5, and multivariate behavior genetic analyses revealed that these observed correlations were themselves entirely attributable to genetic and nonshared environmental factors.

AB Subjective well-being is known to be related to personality traits. However, to date, nobody has examined whether personality and subjective well-being share a common genetic structure. We used a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the hypothesis that heritable differences in subjective well-being are entirely accounted for by the genetic architecture of the Five-Factor Model's personality domains. Results supported this model. Subjective well-being was accounted for by unique genetic influences from Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness, and by a common genetic factor that influenced all five personality domains in the directions of low Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. These findings indicate that subjective well-being is linked to personality by common genes and that personality may form an "affective reserve" relevant to set-point maintenance and changes in set point over time.

AB While evidence supporting for nonadditive genetic influences on personality traits in Caucasian populations has been growing in recent years, twin studies that explored the existence of genetic nonadditivity in personality variation in Asian populations are still lacking. Seven hundred and sixty-five pairs of adolescent and young adult twins registered with the South Korean Twin Registry completed the 7 scales of the Eysenck Personality Scales through a mail survey. Maximum likelihood twin correlations were computed and model-fitting analyses were conducted. Monozygotic twin correlations were consistently higher than twice the dizygotic twin correlations for all 7 scales, suggesting pervasive influences of nonadditive genetic effects on personality traits in the South Korean population. Model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic nonadditivity is particularly important for the variation of Impulsivity, Venturesomeness, Empathy, Lie, and Psychoticism. According to the best fitting models, nonadditive genetic effects ranged from 34 to 49% for these scales. For Neuroticism and Extraversion, models that included an additive genetic component fit better than those including a nonadditive genetic variance component.

AB The primary aim of this study was to conduct a bivariate genetic analysis investigating the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to stability and change in personality factors in the period from adolescence to young adulthood on a sample of Croatian twins. The sample used in this research was formed in 1992 based on a register of citizens of Zagreb and data was collected for 160 twin pairs (75 monozygotic and 85 dizygotic twin pairs). Twins were tested twice, 4 years apart with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (mean age at first time point was 17 years). Univariate analyses indicate that the best fitting model for extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism and lie scale at both time points includes additive genetic (A) and nonshared environmental (E) influences, with heritability estimates in the .40 to .50 range. Longitudinal analyses using AE correlated factors model indicate that genetic factors contribute mainly to stability, while environmental factors contribute mainly to change in personality during that 4-year period of transition from adolescence to young adulthood.

AB A sample of 833 twins from the Minnesota Twin Study of Adult Development and Aging completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ; Tellegen, 1982) twice, averaging 59.4 (sd=9.7) years of age at first and 64.4 (sd=10.2) years of age at second testing (average retest interval 5.0 years, sd=2.36, range 1.0-10.4 years). Both means and standard deviations of scale scores were extremely stable from first to second testing. In addition, sample participants tended to retain their rank order on the scales (average r=.76 across scales). Bivariate biometric analyses showed that the genetic influences on most of the scale scores were almost perfectly correlated across the two waves (range .95 to 1.00). The nonshared environmental influences were also highly correlated across the two waves (range .53 to .73). Models specifying identical variance components at the two time points and fixing the genetic correlation to 1.00 provided improved fit. The results suggest that the high stability of personality in later adulthood has a strong genetic foundation, supplemented by stability of environmental effects.

AB Factors contributing to the development of alexithymia and the nature of alexithymia's relation with trait negative and positive affectivity are unclear. In this study, a twin approach was used to examine the degree of genetic and environmental contributions to the different facets of alexithymia, and the nature of their relations to trait negative and positive affectivity. Method. Forty-five monozygotic and 32 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, the Eysenck Personality Inventory, and a zygosity questionnaire. Results: Model fitting analyses indicated that familial influences contributed significantly to all three facets of alexithymia. Parameter estimates and intraclass correlations suggested, though could not confirm, that it was shared environmental factors that contributed to difficulty identifying and communicating emotions (ID and COM), but shared genetic factors that contributed to externally oriented thinking (EOT). Between-twin cross-trait twin analyses revealed strong correlations between ID and neuroticism, and between COM and extraversion, and suggested that it is shared familial influences which account for these associations. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that: (a) the different facets of alexithymia are influenced by familial factors; (b) the previously noted associations between ID and COM and trait affectivity are not merely methodological artifacts; and (c) the associations between ID and COM and trait affectivity are influenced by familial factors. The results also suggest that ID and COM are largely influenced by shared environmental factors, but that EOT is influenced by genetic factors. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Behavior-genetic models were fit to what the three measures had in common, and to the variance distinctive to each. The results of the model fitting agreed with other recent studies in showing the Big Five dimensions to be substantially and about equally heritable, with little or no contribution of shared family environment. Heritabilities for males and females did not differ significantly. For Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, some effect of shared environment was found for measure-specific variance on the personality inventory, and for Extraversion and Neuroticism, models involving nonadditive genetic variance or twin contrast effects provided slightly better fits.

These parents were themselves either identical twins (n = 90), fraternal twins (n = 56), or adoptive siblings (n = 40). Model-fitting results implicate modest genetic effects on affect-related aspects of parenting, such as parental warmth. The results add new dimensions to the growing body of literature that documents genetic influences on measures of the family environment and suggest that childrearing variables are significantly related to the major factors of parental personality.

AB Previous behavior-genetic research on personality has been almost exclusively based on self-report questionnaire measures. The purpose of this research was to measure personality constructs via self-and peer reports on the items of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1989). The sample included 660 monozygotic and 200 same sex and 104 opposite sex dizygotic twin pairs. We collected self-and two independent peer reports for each of the twins. Our analysis of self-report data replicates earlier findings of a substantial genetic influence on the Big Five (h(2) = .42 to .56). We also found this influence for peer reports. Our results validate findings based solely on self-reports. However, estimates of genetic contributions to phenotypic variance were substantially higher when based on peer reports (h(2) = .57 to .81) or self-and peer reports (h(2) = .66 to .79) because these data allowed us to separate error variance from variance due to nonshared environmental influences. Correlations between self-and peer reports reflected the same genetic influences to a much higher extent than identical environmental effects.

AB Previous research in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) has found genetic influences on life events (R. Plomin, P. Lichtenstein, N. L. Pedersen, G. E. McClearn, & J. R. Nesselroade, 1990). The present study extends this finding by examining sex differences in genetic and environmental contributions to life events and by examining personality as a mediator of genetic influences on life events in SATSA. Analyses were based on 320 twin pairs, including identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart (mean age = 58.6 years). Controllable, desirable, and undesirable life events revealed significant genetic variance only for women. There was no significant genetic variance for either sex for uncontrollable events. Multivariate analyses of personality (as indexed by Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience) and life events suggest that all of the genetic variance on controllable, desirable, and undesirable life events for women is common to personality. Thus, in this sample of older adult women, genetic influences on life events appear to be entirely mediated by personality.

AB MZ twins with spouses and children, altogether 811 subjects, completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ).  For extraversion (E), neuroticism (N), and lying (L), models including only additive genetic effects fitted well to the observed sex-specific correlations for the various sets of relationships.  There was no evidence of sex differences for any parameter estimate for E, N, and L.  The fit for E improved significantly after including dominance, and the fit for L improved significantly after including assortative mating.  A model specifying genetic additive and dominance effects and assortative mating fitted well to the Psychoticism (P) data, but the fit improved significantly when a parameter for cultural transmission from fathers to daughters were included.  Except for this, there was no evidence of cultural transmission for any scores.  The heritabilities for the best-fitting models were .53 (E), .36 (N), .43 (L), and .39 (P).  The latter includes almost only nonadditive, and no additive, variance, suggesting an overestimation of this effect due to random fluctuation or environmental sibling effect misinterpreted as dominance.
