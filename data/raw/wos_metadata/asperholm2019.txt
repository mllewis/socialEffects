AB Objectives: To examine regions of cortical thinning and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers associated with apathy and hallucinations in a continuum of individuals including clinically normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD dementia. Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Setting: Fifty-seven research sites across North America. Participants: Eight-hundred twelve community-dwelling volunteers; 413 participants in the CSF substudy. Measurements: Structural magnetic resonance imaging data and CSF concentrations of amyloid-beta 1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau derived from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were analyzed. Apathy and hallucinations were measured at baseline and over 3 years using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. General linear models and mixed effects models were used to evaluate the relationships among baseline cortical thickness in seven regions, and baseline CSF biomarkers, apathy, and hallucinations at baseline and longitudinally. Covariates included diagnosis, sex, age, apolipoprotein E genotype, premorbid intelligence, memory performance, processing speed, antidepressant use, and AD duration. Results: Reduced baseline inferior temporal cortical thickness was predictive of increasing apathy over time, and reduced supramarginal cortical thickness was predictive of increasing hallucinations over time. There was no association with cortical thickness at baseline. CSF biomarkers were not related to severity of apathy or hallucinations in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. Conclusions: These results suggest that greater baseline temporal and parietal atrophy is associated with worsening apathy and hallucinations in a large AD spectrum cohort, while adjusting for multiple disease-related variables. Localized cortical neurodegeneration may contribute to the pathophysiology of apathy and hallucinations and their adverse consequences in AD.

AB The relationship between manual laterality and cognitive skills remains highly controversial. Some studies have reported that strongly lateralised participants had higher cognitive performance in verbal and visuo-spatial domains compared to non-lateralised participants; however, others found the opposite. Moreover, some have suggested that familial sinistrality and sex might interact with individual laterality factors to alter cognitive skills. The present study addressed these issues in 237 right-handed and 199 left-handed individuals. Performance tests covered various aspects of verbal and spatial cognition. A principal component analysis yielded two verbal and one spatial factor scores. Participant laterality assessments included handedness, manual preference strength, asymmetry of motor performance, and familial sinistrality. Age, sex, education level, and brain volume were also considered. No effect of handedness was found, but the mean factor scores in verbal and spatial domains increased with right asymmetry in motor performance. Performance was reduced in participants with a familial history of left-handedness combined with a non-maximal preference strength in the dominant hand. These results elucidated some discrepancies among previous findings in laterality factors and cognitive skills. Laterality factors had small effects compared to the adverse effects of age for spatial cognition and verbal memory, the positive effects of education for all three domains, and the effect of sex for spatial cognition.

AB Although there has been considerable interest in identifying potential correlates of cognitive change, results of past studies have been inconsistent. The present study incorporated a number of methodological features intended to maximize sensitivity to detect characteristics of individuals with different amounts of cognitive change. Cognitive change in 5 cognitive abilities was analyzed with 2nd-order latent growth curve models applied to data from a moderately large sample of healthy adults ranging from 18 to 99 years of age (Ns of 4,802 with 1 occasion, 2,265 with 2 occasions, and 1,128 with 3 occasions). There was significant individual difference variance in the longitudinal changes in several cognitive abilities, even in separate analyses of individuals between 18 years of age and 39, between 40 and 64, and 65 and over. Potential correlates of change included measures of self-rated health, vision, mood, personality, and lifestyle. Most of the potential correlates of change had high reliability, and several analyses were based on even more reliable factors determined by the variance common to multiple measures. Despite favorable conditions for detecting correlates of change, there was little evidence that cognitive change was moderated by any of the variables examined. Possible reasons for the inconsistent results regarding correlates of cognitive change are discussed.

AB It is well established that memory is more accurate for own-relative to other-race faces (own-race bias), which has been suggested to result from larger perceptual expertise for own-race faces. Previous studies also demonstrated better memory for own-relative to other-gender faces, which is less likely to result from differences in perceptual expertise, and rather may be related to social in-group vs out-group categorization. We examined neural correlates of the own-gender bias using event-related potentials (ERP). In a recognition memory experiment, both female and male participants remembered faces of their respective own gender more accurately compared with other-gender faces. ERPs during learning yielded significant differences between the subsequent memory effects (subsequently remembered - subsequently forgotten) for own-gender compared with other-gender faces in the occipito-temporal P2 and the central N200, whereas neither later subsequent memory effects nor ERP old/new effects at test reflected a neural correlate of the own-gender bias. We conclude that the own-gender bias is mainly related to study phase processes, which is in line with sociocognitive accounts.

AB The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of more than 37 000 individuals over age 50 in 23 000 households in the USA. The survey, which has been fielded every 2 years since 1992, was established to provide a national resource for data on the changing health and economic circumstances associated with ageing at both individual and population levels. Its multidisciplinary approach is focused on four broad topics-income and wealth; health, cognition and use of healthcare services; work and retirement; and family connections. HRS data are also linked at the individual level to administrative records from Social Security and Medicare, Veteran's Administration, the National Death Index and employer-provided pension plan information. Since 2006, data collection has expanded to include biomarkers and genetics as well as much greater depth in psychology and social context. This blend of economic, health and psychosocial information provides unprecedented potential to study increasingly complex questions about ageing and retirement. The HRS has been a leading force for rapid release of data while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of respondents. Three categories of data-public, sensitive and restricted-can be accessed through procedures described on the HRS website ( ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/" xlink:type="simple">hrsonline.isr.umich.edu).

AB Objective: Clinic-based studies suggest that dementia is diagnosed at older ages in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. The current study sought to test this hypothesis in a large, prospective, community-based study of initially nondemented Hispanic immigrants living in a Spanish-speaking enclave of northern Manhattan. Method: Participants included 1,067 participants in the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were tested in Spanish and followed at 18-24 month intervals for up to 23 years. Spanish-English bilingualism was estimated via both self-report and an objective measure of English reading level. Multilevel models for change estimated the independent effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline in 4 domains: episodic memory, language, executive function, and speed. Over the course of the study, 282 participants developed dementia. Cox regression was used to estimate the independent effect of bilingualism on dementia conversion. Covariates included country of origin, gender, education, time spent in the United States, recruitment cohort, and age at enrollment. Results: Independent of the covariates, bilingualism was associated with better memory and executive function at baseline. However, bilingualism was not independently associated with rates of cognitive decline or dementia conversion. Results were similar whether bilingualism was measured via self-report or an objective test of reading level. Conclusions: This study does not support a protective effect of bilingualism on age-related cognitive decline or the development of dementia. In this sample of Hispanic immigrants, bilingualism is related to higher initial scores on cognitive tests and higher educational attainment and may not represent a unique source of cognitive reserve.

AB Background: Adult-onset primary dystonia is thought to be a purely motor disorder. Nevertheless, several studies provided evidence that sensory and psychiatric disturbances may contribute to the clinical spectrum of of dystonia, whereas evidence supporting cognitive impairment is still limited.
   Methods: A set of neuropsychological tests was administered to non depressed, non demented patients with cranial-cervical dystonia and healthy control subjects. The test battery included n-Back Task, Wechsler Memory Scale, Trail Making Test version A and B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.
   Results: As compared with healthy control subjects of similar age, sex and socio-economic status, patients with cranial-cervical dystonia showed deficit on working memory functions revealed by n-Back task, impairment of mental control and visual reproduction subtests of Wechsler memory scale, deficit on information processing speed and set-shifting capacity revealed by Trail Making Test A and B.
   Conclusion: Patients with cranial-cervical dystonia may have impairment in specific cognitive domains relative to working memory, processing speed, visual motor ability and short term memory. Probably, these deficits are not dependent on the clinical expression of dystonia but might rather reflect the cortical and subcortical changes highlighted by functional and VBM imaging studies in patients with different forms of dystonia.

AB Background: Studies investigating bipolar disorder (BD) showed that healthy patterns of sex differences in cognitive functioning are altered within this population, but is it unknown whether these alterations are present in BD patients early in their course of illness.
   Methods: Patients with bipolar l disorder (36 males, 38 female), who had recently experienced their first manic or mixed episode were tested along with healthy controls (39 males, 59 females) similar in age, sex and premorbid IQ Cognitive function was assessed through a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.
   Results: Significant group effects were found in a majority of administered tests (p 005) with patients performing worse than healthy controls. Significant sex effects (p <005) were observed on tasks of spatial working memory and sustained attention, with males performing better than females. No significant group by sex interaction was found in any of the tasks administered.
   Limitations: The cognitive battery employed in this study may not have been optimally sensitive in detecting sex differences.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that unlike patients with long standing multi-episode BD or schizophrenia, healthy cognitive sex differences are maintained in patients with early BD, following recovery from a first-episode of mania. These findings highlight the progressive nature of the illness and provide justification for an early intervention. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to verify whether male patients with psychosis have greater neurocognitive impairment than female patients at illness onset.
   Method: Participants with a first episode of psychosis (74 women/86 men) and healthy controls (62 women/97 men) were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery.
   Results: Women in the clinical group were older at illness onset and had achieved higher formal education than men. This trend was the same for the control group. The patient group presented with lower premorbid IQ compared to healthy controls, and performed below for most neuropsychological tests. Women scored higher than men on a test of verbal memory, whereas men scored higher than women on a test of reaction time, visual memory, and a planning task. There were no group-by-sex interactions for any of the neuropsychological tests.
   Conclusion: The present study shows that at the onset of psychosis there are no differences between males and females in neuropsychological performance. The differential pattern of cognitive performance observed is similar to that in healthy males and females. Furthermore, females with a late onset of psychosis may represent a subgroup with specific visuospatial and problem solving impairments.
   Significant outcomes:
   1- The present study does not give support to the hypothesis that male have worse neurocognitive functioning than female patients at illness onset.
   2- The neuropsychological profile of sex differences observed among patients is consistent with that observed among controls.
   3- We identified a subgroup of female patients with late onset that differed in their degree and pattern of cognitive impairment with regard to their male counterparts.
   Limitations:
   1-Factors other than neurocognitive functioning may underlie the more severe impairment observed in the onset and course of illness in men.
   2- Although the study used a broad battery of well established tests, this battery may lack sensitivity to detect sex differences.
   3- A longitudinal study is required to further explore whether sex specific deficits require special rehabilitation programs for patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Cognitive impairment (CI) in multiple sclerosis (MS) can develop any time. CI is associated with the degree of neuronal loss, but disease duration, fatigue, comorbid affective disorder, and drug dose may also affect cognition. Our aim was to assess which cognitive domain was disturbed primarily in mild MS patients and to see whether CI was related with clinical and psychiatric features. Method. Neurological and psychiatric evaluation of 31 MS patients and 31 age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls were made with Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). Depression, anxiety, functionality, fatigue, and disability scoring were determined with Hamilton Depression-Anxiety scales, Global Assessment of Functionality, Fatigue Severity and Expanded Disability Status Scales. Cognitive functions were assessed using Mini Mental, Serial Digit Learning, Verbal and Nonverbal Cancellation, Stroop and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning tests. Results. Retrieval from long-term memory and psychomotor speed were significantly worse in MS group. CI was correlated with disease duration, number of attacks, and physical disability but not with depression and anxiety severity. Disease duration predicted disturbances in recall and psychomotor speed, whereas fatigue and disability predicted depression. Conclusion. Psychomotor speed and memory were primarily impaired in MS patients, and CI was closely associated with clinical aspects of MS rather than with depression and anxiety.

AB Building on the simulated-amnesia work of Christianson and Bylin (Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13, 495-511, 1999), the present research introduces a new paradigm for the scientific study of memory of childhood sexual abuse information. In Session 1, participants mentally took the part of an abuse victim as they read an account of the sexual assault of a 7-year-old. After reading the narrative, participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: They (1) rehearsed the story truthfully (truth group), (2) left out the abuse details of the story (omission group), (3) lied about the abuse details to indicate that no abuse had occurred (commission group), or (4) did not recall the story during Session 1 (no-rehearsal group). One week later, participants returned for Session 2 and were asked to truthfully recall the narrative. The results indicated that, relative to truthful recall, untruthful recall or no rehearsal at Session 1 adversely affected memory performance at Session 2. However, untruthful recall resulted in better memory than did no rehearsal. Moreover, gender, PTSD symptoms, depression, adult attachment, and sexual abuse history significantly predicted memory for the childhood sexual abuse scenario. Implications for theory and application are discussed.

AB Arterial stiffness may be associated with cognitive function. In this study, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured from the carotid to femoral (CF-PWV) and from the carotid to radial (CR-PWV) with the Complior SP System. Cognitive function was measured by 6 tests of executive function, psychomotor speed, memory, and language fluency. A total of 1433 participants were included (mean age 75 y, 43% men). Adjusting for age, sex, education, pulse rate, hemoglobin A1C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, cardiovascular disease history, smoking, drinking, and depression symptoms, a CF-PWV > 12 m/s was associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (coefficient: -0.31, SE: 0.11, P=0.005), fewer words recalled on Auditory Verbal Learning Test (coefficient: -1.10, SE: 0.43, P=0.01), and lower score on the composite cognition score (coefficient: -0.10, SE: 0.05, P=0.04) and marginally significantly associated with longer time to complete Trail Making Test-part B (coefficient: 6.30, SE: 3.41, P=0.06), CF-PWV was not associated with Trail Making Test-part A, Digit Symbol Substation Test, or Verbal Fluency Test. No associations were found between CR-PWV and cognitive performance measures. Higher large artery stiffness was associated with worse cognitive function, and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations.

AB Normative test scores often are corrected for demographic variables that can have an impact on neurocognitive abilities (e.g., gender, age, education, and ethnicity). The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are gender differences on the CNS Vital Signs computerized neurocognitive test battery. Participants, selected from a large normative database, were 100 healthy adults aged 18 to 68 years old (M-age = 35.8 years, SD = 13.6) with 15.5 years of education (SD = 2.2). Men (n = 50) and women (n = 50) were individually and precisely matched on age, education, ethnicity, computer use, occupation, and handedness. This battery of seven tests yields 23 test scores, 5 domain scores (Memory, Psychomotor Speed, Reaction Time, Complex Attention, and Cognitive Flexibility), and a total score. Men had significantly better scores than did women on the Finger-Tapping Test for the right hand (p = .006, Cohen's d = 0.57). No other scores were significantly different, although there were small-medium effect sizes in favor of women on Symbol-Digit Coding (d = .39) and Verbal Memory (d = .37). The trends toward gender differences in word-list recognition memory and processing speed are consistent with the literature, but because they were nonsignificant and the effect sizes were modest, the clinician likely does not need to factor this into test interpretation.

AB Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that schizophrenia patients may perform worse than normal controls in several cognitive tasks. However, little is known on putative differences in cognitive functioning between schizophrenia patients responding to antipsychotics and those resistant to the treatment. In this cross-sectional study, 63 subjects (41 schizophrenia and schizoaffective patients and 22 age and sex-matched controls) were enrolled. Patients were divided in resistant (TRS, n=19) and nonresistant to pharmacological treatment (non-TRS, n=22) according to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) criteria for treatment resistance. The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) was administered to patients and controls. The following rating scales were administered to schizophrenia patients: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and the Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics (SWN). Statistically significant differences among non-TRS patients, TRS ones, and controls were detected at the SACS. TRS patients performed significantly worse than non-TRS ones on Verbal Memory task, exhibited higher PANSS total and subscales scores and were prescribed higher antipsychotic doses. Poorer performances at the BACS significantly correlated with more severe negative symptoms in TRS but not in non-TRS patients. These results may suggest that TRS patients suffer from a form of the disease with prominent cognitive impairment possibly related to negative symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: To examine the underlying pathophysiology of mild traumatic brain injury through changes in gray matter diffusion and atrophy during the semiacute stage.
   Methods: Fifty patients and 50 sex-, age-, and education-matched controls were evaluated with a clinical and neuroimaging battery approximately 14 days postinjury, with 26 patients returning for follow-up 4 months postinjury. Clinical measures included tests of attention, processing speed, executive function, working memory, memory, and self-reported postconcussive symptoms. Measures of diffusion (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity) and atrophy were obtained for cortical and subcortical structures to characterize effects of injury as a function of time.
   Results: Patients reported more cognitive, somatic, and emotional complaints during the semiacute injury phase, which were significantly reduced 4 months postinjury. Patients showed evidence of increased FA in the bilateral superior frontal cortex during the semiacute phase, with the left superior frontal cortex remaining elevated 4 months postinjury. There were no significant differences between patients and matched controls on neuropsychological testing or measures of gray matter atrophy/mean diffusivity at either time point.
   Conclusions: Increased cortical FA is largely consistent with an emerging animal literature of gray matter abnormalities after neuronal injury. Potential mechanistic explanations for increased FA include cytotoxic edema or reactive gliosis. In contrast, there was no evidence of cortical or subcortical atrophy in the current study, suggesting that frank neuronal or neuropil loss does not occur early in the chronic disease course for patients with typical mild traumatic brain injury.

   SERUM; NR2A; ANTAGONISTS; DEPRESSION
AB ObjectiveOur understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is incomplete. In systemic lupus erythematosus, it has been reported that antibodies directed against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype NR2 (anti-NR2) interfere with memory and learning function, as well as mood. This has not been investigated in primary SS; however, the present study was undertaken to advance our understanding of neuropsychiatric involvement in this disease.
   MethodsSixty-six patients with primary SS and 66 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects underwent clinical examination and neuropsychological evaluation. Anti-NR2 antibodies were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Hippocampus volume was estimated using software extensions to SPM5.
   ResultsPatients with primary SS had smaller hippocampi than healthy subjects (mean SD 8.15 +/- 0.98 cm(3) versus 8.49 +/- 0.88 cm(3); P = 0.01). In patients with primary SS, anti-NR2 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid were associated with a worse performance in 8 of 10 memory and learning tests, and anti-NR2 antibodies in serum were associated with a worse performance in 6 of those same tests. In addition, a higher proportion of patients with depression than patients without depression had serum anti-NR2 antibody levels above the cutoff value.
   ConclusionResults of this study indicate that anti-NR2 antibodies may represent one of the pathogenetic mechanisms for cognitive disturbances and mood disorders in patients with primary SS.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to examine neurodevelopment, psychological adjustment, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescents after bypass surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) during early childhood.
   MethodFifty-nine adolescents (34 females, 25 males) with CHD were examined at a median age of 13years 8months (range 11y 5mo-16y 11mo). Outcome was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, (fourth edition); the Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration; the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test; the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment; the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; and the KIDSCREEN questionnaires. Results were compared with those of 40 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison individuals.
   ResultsOutcome with regard to full-scale IQ, perceptual reasoning, and the working memory scale was poorer in patients with CHD than in the comparison group (all p0.001). Visual perception, visuomotor integration (p0.001), and executive functions (Rey figure copy: p=0.05) were also affected. Patients with CHD also had lower scores on all motor domains (p<0.02) except static balance. Psychological adjustment was affected only in the peer relationship' domain (p=0.05). Quality of life was similar to that of typically developing peers.
   InterpretationAdolescents with CHD may manifest persistent cognitive and motor impairments, while psychological adjustment and self-reported HRQoL are mostly typical. Thus, long-term neurodevelopmental evaluations are necessary to provide early educational and therapeutic support.

AB Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cannabis use are each associated with specific cognitive deficits. Few studies have investigated the neurocognitive profile of individuals with both an ADHD history and regular cannabis use. The greatest cognitive impairment is expected among ADHD Cannabis Users compared to those with ADHD-only, Cannabis use-only, or neither.
   Methods: Young adults (24.2 +/- 1.2 years) with a childhood ADHD diagnosis who did (n = 42) and did not (n = 45) report past year >= monthly cannabis use were compared on neuropsychological measures to a local normative comparison group (LNCG) who did (n = 20) and did not (n = 21) report past year regular cannabis use. Age, gender, IQ, socioeconomic status, and past year alcohol and smoking were statistical covariates.
   Results: The ADHD group performed worse than LNCG on verbal memory, processing speed, cognitive interference, decision-making, working memory, and response inhibition. No significant effects for cannabis use emerged. Interactions between ADHD and cannabis were non-significant. Exploratory analyses revealed that individuals who began using cannabis regularly before age 16 (n = 27) may have poorer executive functioning (i.e., decision-making, working memory, and response inhibition), than users who began later (n = 32); replication is warranted with a larger sample.
   Conclusions: A childhood diagnosis of ADHD, but not cannabis use in adulthood, was associated with executive dysfunction. Earlier initiation of cannabis use may be linked to poor cognitive outcomes and a significantly greater proportion of the ADHD group began using cannabis before age 16. Regular cannabis use starting after age 16 may not be sufficient to aggravate longstanding cognitive deficits characteristic of ADHD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a panel study of a representative cohort of men and women living in England aged epsilon 50 years. It was designed as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Study in the USA and is multidisciplinary in orientation, involving the collection of economic, social, psychological, cognitive, health, biological and genetic data. The study commenced in 2002, and the sample has been followed up every 2 years. Data are collected using computer-assisted personal interviews and self-completion questionnaires, with additional nurse visits for the assessment of biomarkers every 4 years. The original sample consisted of 11 391 members ranging in age from 50 to 100 years. ELSA is harmonized with ageing studies in other countries to facilitate international comparisons, and is linked to financial and health registry data. The data set is openly available to researchers and analysts soon after collection (http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/elsa/l5050.asp).

AB Background: Early treatment of Alzheimer's disease may reduce its devastating effects. By focusing research on asymptomatic individuals with Alzheimer's disease pathology (the preclinical stage), earlier indicators of disease may be discovered. Decreasing cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid(42) is the first indicator of preclinical disorder, but it is not known which pathology causes the first clinical effects. Our hypothesis is that neuropsychological changes within the normal range will help to predict preclinical disease and locate early pathology.
   Methods and Findings: We recruited adults with probable Alzheimer's disease or asymptomatic cognitively healthy adults, classified after medical and neuropsychological examination. By logistic regression, we derived a cutoff for the cerebrospinal fluid beta amyloid(42)/tau ratios that correctly classified 85% of those with Alzheimer's disease. We separated the asymptomatic group into those with (n = 34; preclinical Alzheimer's disease) and without (n = 36; controls) abnormal beta amyloid42/tau ratios; these subgroups had similar distributions of age, gender, education, medications, apolipoprotein-e genotype, vascular risk factors, and magnetic resonance imaging features of small vessel disease. Multivariable analysis of neuropsychological data revealed that only Stroop Interference (response inhibition) independently predicted preclinical pathology (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04-0.42). Lack of longitudinal and post-mortem data, older age, and small population size are limitations of this study.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that clinical effects from early amyloid pathophysiology precede those from hippocampal intraneuronal neurofibrillary pathology. Altered cerebrospinal fluid beta amyloid(42) with decreased executive performance before memory impairment matches the deposits of extracellular amyloid that appear in the basal isocortex first, and only later involve the hippocampus. We propose that Stroop Interference may be an additional important screen for early pathology and useful to monitor treatment of preclinical Alzheimer's disease; measures of executive and memory functions in a longitudinal design will be necessary to more fully evaluate this approach.

For each patient, two age- and gender-matched controls were tested at similar intervals. Standardized regression-based (SRB) analysis was applied to compare post-surgical change in individual patients with change in controls.
   Results: Group-wise, average normed scores on verbal memory tests were higher after epilepsy surgery than before, corroborating earlier reports. By dint of empirically based SRB analysis, however, considerable individual differences in post-surgical change were revealed. Children with resections that included the left temporal lobe functioned significantly poorer than predicted on the basis of their pre-surgical performance. In contrast, verbal memory performance after surgery was consistent with pre-surgical baseline in the majority of children with resections that spared the left temporal lobe.
   Conclusions: Despite cessation of epileptic seizures, verbal memory remains vulnerable in children who required surgery including the left temporal lobe. In most - but not all - children with other types of surgery, post-surgical verbal memory is consistent with their individual pre-surgical base level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research has shown females' advantage in face memory, but few studies have used emotional faces as stimuli. In addition, it is unclear whether gender difference in memory for faces is mediated by individual factors especially associated with emotion. This study examined gender difference in recognition memory for neutral and emotional faces and whether arousal predisposition, emotion reappraisal, and emotion suppression can play a mediation role. Females (N=48) and males (N=45) viewed and memorised neutral, happy, and angry faces, and then took an immediate recognition test. The findings are: (1) Females outperformed males in recognition memory for happy faces, but not for neutral and negative faces. (2) Gender difference in recognition memory (including recollection and familiarity) was not mediated by arousal predisposition and emotion regulation. (3) Females had an own-sex bias in that they outperformed males with regard to recognition memory only for female faces, but not for male faces. The findings suggest that females' advantage is mediated by valence of face emotionality but not by arousal predisposition and emotion regulation, thus extending the literature by demonstrating the boundary condition for occurrence of females' advantage.

AB Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most common viruses causing central nervous system (CNS) infection, sometimes with severe neurological complications and sequelae despite appropriate antiviral treatment. Whether the neurological sequelae of VZV CNS infections include long-term cognitive impairment and how this impairment might affect the patients is still largely unknown. In this study, 14 patients with predominant CNS manifestations caused by VZV infection underwent cognitive testing 3 years (median 39.5 months, range 31-52 months) after acute disease. The results were compared with those for 28 controls, matched for age and gender. The tests covered the cognitive domains of speed and attention, memory and learning, visuospatial function, language and executive function. To further assess the cognitive dysfunction caused by neurological VZV infection, patients were classified into the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with development of dementia in other pathologies. The VZV patients performed significantly worse than controls on four tests covering the domains of speed and attention, memory and learning and executive function. The cut-off was set at 1.5 SD below mean age. In addition, a greater proportion of VZV patients were classified with MCI as compared with controls. In conclusion, patients with previous VZV infection affecting the brain had signs of long-term cognitive impairment in the domains of speed and attention, memory and learning and executive function. However, larger study populations are needed to confirm these results.

AB Identification of predictors of cognitive trajectories through the establishment of composite or single-parameter dimensional categories of cognition and mood may facilitate development of strategies to improve quality of life in the elderly. Participants (n = 487, aged 50+ years) were representative of the Portuguese population in terms of age, gender, and educational status. Cognitive and mood profiles were established using a battery of neurocognitive and psychological tests. Data were subjected to principal component analysis to identify core dimensions of cognition and mood, encompassing multiple test variables. Dimensions were correlated with age and with respect to gender, education, and occupational status. Cluster analysis was applied to isolate distinct patterns of cognitive performance and binary logistic regression models to explore interrelationships between aging, cognition, mood, and socio-demographic characteristics. Four main dimensions were identified: memory, executive function, global cognitive status, and mood. Based on these, strong and weak cognitive performers were distinguishable. Cluster analysis revealed further distinction within these two main categories into very good, good, poor, and very poor performers. Mood was the principal factor contributing to the separation between very good and good, as well as poor and very poor, performers. Clustering was also influenced by gender and education, albeit to a lesser extent; notably, however, female gender x lower educational background predicted significantly poorer cognitive performance with increasing age. Mood has a significant impact on the rate of cognitive decline in the elderly. Gender and educational level are early determinants of cognitive performance in later life.

AB Does face recognition ability mature early in childhood (early maturation hypothesis) or does it continue to develop well into adulthood (late maturation hypothesis)? This fundamental issue in face recognition is typically addressed by comparing child and adult participants. However, the interpretation of such studies is complicated by children's inferior test-taking abilities and general cognitive functions. Here we examined the developmental trajectory of face recognition ability in an individual differences study of 18-33 year-olds (n = 2,032), an age interval in which participants are competent test takers with comparable general cognitive functions. We found a positive association between age and face recognition, controlling for nonface visual recognition, verbal memory, sex, and own-race bias. Our study supports the late maturation hypothesis in face recognition, and illustrates how individual differences investigations of young adults can address theoretical issues concerning the development of perceptual and cognitive abilities.

AB Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome caused by liver cirrhosis and accompanied by a broad spectrum of cognitive symptoms. The objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and to compare their cognitive performance with controls using standardized tests. Patients receiving medication or experiencing comorbidities associated with cognitive disorders were excluded. The final cohort was compared with a control-matched group using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as Simple Drawing, Clock Drawing, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Random Letter, Stroop, Trail-Making Test (TMT) A and B, Boston Naming, Category Verbal Fluency, Digit Span, Constructional Praxis, Processing Speed, and Similarities Tests. The results indicated no differences in the prevalence of cognitive complaints spontaneously reported by 29 patients with cirrhosis versus 22 healthy controls. The most affected tests included: MMSE (26.3 +/- 2 vs. 28.1 +/- 1.8 points; p = 0.004), learning (35.4 +/- 9 vs. 41 +/- 9.1 points; p = 0.041), retroactive interference (0.67 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.16 points; p = 0.004), and recognition (8.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 11.2 +/- 4.1 points; p = 0.024) in RAVLT, TMT-A (63.2 +/- 29.3 vs. 47.6 +/- 16.5 s; p = 0.029) and TMT-B (197.9 +/- 88.1 vs. 146.8 +/- 76.5 s; p = 0.03). No differences were observed with respect to age, gender, and education. In conclusion, MMSE proved to be a useful tool for detecting global cognitive impairment experienced by cirrhosis patients. Moreover, the most impaired cognitive functions were verbal episodic memory and information processing speed. These findings suggest that minimal hepatic encephalopathy represents a disorder that affects the medial temporal system and, possibly, the prefrontal cortex, and this requires further study.

AB This study examined age differences in collaborative inhibition and the role of intersubjectivity, collective information sampling (CIS) and collaborative inhibition for the collaborative recall of shared and unshared information in groups of 7-and 9-year-old children. Three-hundred and thirteen 7-and 9-year-old children recalled memorized wordlists either in real or nominal groups of three. All group members either recalled the same items, or each group member was given some unique items. Nine-year-olds, but not 7-year-olds, recalled significantly more items in nominal than real groups, a phenomenon called collaborative inhibition. Groups whose interactions were characterized by higher numbers of inter-subjective exchanges recalled fewer words than groups low in intersubjectivity. In both age groups, a higher proportion of shared compared with unshared information was recalled consistent with processes of CIS. However, 7-year-olds recalled more unshared items than predicted, suggesting that collaborative inhibition additionally contributes to the recall of shared and unshared items.

AB The main focus of this study is to illustrate the applicability of latent class analysis in the assessment of cognitive performance profiles during ageing. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect main cognitive dimensions (based on the neurocognitive test variables) and Bayesian latent class analysis (LCA) models (without constraints) were used to explore patterns of cognitive performance among community-dwelling older individuals. Gender, age and number of school years were explored as variables. Three cognitive dimensions were identified: general cognition (MMSE), memory (MEM) and executive (EXEC) function. Based on these, three latent classes of cognitive performance profiles (LC1 to LC3) were identified among the older adults. These classes corresponded to stronger to weaker performance patterns (LC1>LC2>LC3) across all dimensions; each latent class denoted the same hierarchy in the proportion of males, age and number of school years. Bayesian LCA provided a powerful tool to explore cognitive typologies among healthy cognitive agers.

TI The effect of beverages varying in glycaemic load on postprandial

AB Reducing glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) inconsistently improves aspects of cognitive function and appetite in children. Whether altering the GL by lowering carbohydrate relative to protein and fat has a role in these effects is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the differential effects of beverages varying in GL and dairy composition on appetite, energy intake and cognitive function in children. A total of forty children (10-12 years) completed a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial, receiving three isoenergetic drinks (approximately 1100 kJ): a glucose beverage (GI 100, GL 65), a full milk beverage (GI 27, GL 5) and a half milk/glucose beverage (GI 84, GL 35). For 3 h post-consumption, subjective appetite and cognitive performance (speed of processing, memory, attention and perceptual speed) were measured hourly. At completion, each child was provided a buffet-style lunch and energy intake was calculated. Blood glucose was objectively measured using the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System. Blood glucose AUC values were significantly different between the drinks (P<0.001), but did not sustain above the baseline for 3 h for any drink. Mixed modelling revealed no effect of beverage on subjective appetite or energy intake. Participant sex and drink GL significantly interacted for short-term memory (P<0.001). When girls consumed either milk-containing beverage, they recalled 0.7-0.8 more words compared with 0.5 less words after the glucose drink (P <= 0.014). Altering GL of drinks by reducing carbohydrate and increasing protein did not affect appetite or cognition in children. Girls may demonstrate improved short-term memory after consuming beverages with higher protein and lower GL.

AB Context: Recent evidence indicates that thyroid hormones may be closely linked to cognition among adults.
   Objective: We investigated associations between thyroid hormones and cognitive performance, while testing effect modification by sex, race, and elevated depressive symptoms (EDS).
   Design: This cross-sectional study used extensive data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study.
   Setting: The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2004 to 2009.
   Participants: Participants were U.S. adults aged 30 to 64 years. The sample size ranged from 1275 to 1346.
   Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes included 13 cognitive test scores spanning domains of learning/memory, language/verbal, attention, visuo-spatial/visuo-construction, psychomotor speed, executive function, and mental status.
   Results: Within reference ranges and after Bonferroni correction, elevated free thyroxine (fT(4)) was associated with better performance on tests of visuo-spatial/visuo-construction ability (overall, women, and African Americans) and learning/memory (women and African Americans), whereas a higher total thyroxine (tT(4)) level was associated with better performance in the domain of psychomotor speed (individuals without EDS) and higher levels of both fT(4) and tT(4) were linked to better language/verbal test performance among men. In contrast, higher T3(% uptake) was related to better performance on tests of visuo-spatial/visuo-construction ability and psychomotor speed among whites. When the above reference range was compared within the overall population and after Bonferroni correction, a within reference range fT(4) was linked to better performance on visuo-spatial/visuo-constrution ability and psychomotor speed, whereas a below normal range TSH level (compared with the reference range) was linked to better performance in domains of psychomotor speed and attention.
   Conclusions: Thyroid hormones and cognition are closely linked differentially by sex, race, and EDS status.

AB Studies have shown that emotion elicited after learning enhances memory consolidation. However, no prior studies have used facial photos as stimuli. This study examined the effect of post-learning positive emotion on consolidation of memory for faces. During the learning participants viewed neutral, positive, or negative faces. Then they were assigned to a condition in which they either watched a 9-minute positive video clip, or a 9-minute neutral video. Then 30 minutes after the learning participants took a surprise memory test, in which they made remember, know, and new judgements. The findings are: (1) Positive emotion enhanced consolidation of recognition for negative male faces, but impaired consolidation of recognition for negative female faces; (2) For males, recognition for negative faces was equivalent to that for positive faces; for females, recognition for negative faces was better than that for positive faces. Our study provides the important evidence that effect of post-learning emotion on memory consolidation can extend to facial stimuli and such an effect can be modulated by facial valence and facial gender. The findings may shed light on establishing models concerning the influence of emotion on memory consolidation.

AB Objectives: To examine whether depressive symptoms are useful predictors of subjective memory complaints in community-dwelling older adults, beyond the predictive utility already provided by memory performance and characteristics of personality. Design: Using hierarchical regression, we examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints, controlling for age, gender, education, memory performance, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. Participants: Community-dwelling older adults aged 66 to 90 years (N = 177) who responded to a newspaper advertisement for a memory study in Perth, Western Australia. Measurements: The General Frequency of Forgetting scale (for memory complaints), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (for depressive symptoms), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (for conscientiousness and neuroticism), and the Visual Reproduction and Logical Memory subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale-4th Edition (for visual and verbal memory). Results: The hierarchical regression analysis indicated that while depressive symptoms significantly predicted memory complaints after variance associated with age, gender, education, memory performance, and conscientiousness was partialled out, they accounted for almost none of the variance in complaints when neuroticism was partialled out. Conclusions: The well-established relationship between depression and memory complaints may exist in some community-dwelling older adult populations only on account of the manner in which both are associated with neuroticism.

AB The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), and the Isaacs Set Test (IST) are useful instruments in the neuropsychological assessment of older individuals. Several versions of these tests exist in Spanish but normative data specifically set up for Mexican older adult population are missing although Mexico is the country containing the largest population of Spanish speakers and is undergoing a demographic transition with its aging population. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to produce age, educational level, and gender-adjusted normative scores for these tests for the population of older adults living in Mexico. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1047 subjects aged 70 years and over who participated in the Coyoacan cohort study, a population-based cohort study conducted in Mexico City. Results: Normative scores, presented in percentiles, were calculated according to age (70-79 and 80 years and over), educational level (0 years of schooling vs. 1-5 years of schooling vs. 6 and more years of schooling), and gender. Conclusion: This work provides norms for the MMSE, the FCSRT, and the IST which should be useful in clinical practice and helpful to better interpret the performances of Mexican older people consulting for memory troubles.

AB There is ample evidence that physical and cognitive performance are related, but the results of studies investigating this relationship show great variability. Both physical performance and cognitive performance are constructs consisting of several subdomains, but it is presently unknown if the relationship between physical and cognitive performance depends on subdomain of either construct and whether gender and age moderate this relationship. The aim of this study is to identify the strongest physical predictors of cognitive performance, to determine the specificity of these predictors for various cognitive subdomains, and to examine gender and age as potential moderators of the relationship between physical and cognitive performance in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. In total, 98 men and 122 women (average age 74.0 +/- 5.6 years) were subjected to a series of performance-based physical fitness and neuropsychological tests. Muscle strength, balance, functional reach, and walking ability (combined score of walking speed and endurance) were considered to predict cognitive performance across several domains (i.e. memory, verbal attention, visual attention, set-shifting, visuo-motor attention, inhibition and intelligence). Results showed that muscle strength was a significant predictor of cognitive performance for men and women. Walking ability and balance were significant predictors of cognitive performance for men, whereas only walking ability was significant for women. We did not find a moderating effect of age, nor did we find support for a differential effect of the physical predictors across different cognitive subdomains. In summary, our results showed a significant relationship between cognitive and physical performance, with a moderating effect of gender.

AB Objective: Although several studies have examined neuropsychological functions in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), findings are not conclusive, predominantly due to small samples and assessment of limited domains. We aim to map the neuropsychological profile of OCD in a large sample with a comprehensive battery of tests.
   Method: Neuropsychological functions were tested in 150 subjects with DSM-IV OCD and 205 healthy control subjects.
   Results: Subjects with OCD performed significantly worse than healthy control subjects on Colour Trails 1 time, Tower of Hanoi 3-disk time, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test categories completed, Iowa Gambling Task, Complex Figure Test immediate and delayed recall (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Subjects with OCD evince deficits in scanning, planning time, concept formation, decision making and encoding of non-verbal memory after controlling for the effects of age, gender and education. The profile is suggestive of a predominantly executive dysfunction, with difficulties in strategizing and organizing stimuli and cognitive resources for maximum efficiency. The findings implicate dorsolateral prefrontal, superior medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, suggesting that OCD might not be a purely orbitofronto-striatal disorder as previously conceptualized.

AB Aim: Episodic memory is vulnerable to deterioration in people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the Logical Memory (LM) subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) is used internationally as an operational definition to identify people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the Japanese version of the LM has not been adequately normalized for old-old people. Therefore, norms of the LM for people aged 75 years and over are required, and the effects of sex, age and education on performance were evaluated.
   Methods: A total of 50 (27 female and 23 male) participants without a history of dementia and symptomatic stroke events recruited from the community and hospital populations were investigated using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the LM and some interference tasks.
   Results: The mean scores (standard deviations) of the sample were 15.5 (5.4) on LM-I and 9.9 (6.6) on LM-II. The distributions of the LM-I and -II scores satisfied the normality assumption. The LM-I and LM-II scores correlated with age and the LM-I score correlated with educational background.
   Conclusions: For the Japanese version of the LM, the means, standard deviations and distribution features of the old-old sample are presented. Although the normal sample was chosen to closely match the demographic profile of the Japanese population, the present sample might have had a higher educational background than the age-matched population, especially the males. Further study is required to standardize the Japanese version of the LM subtest for each 5-year interval for latter-stage elderly people. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2013; 13: 726-730.

AB Background: Community (CC) or orthopaedic/injury (OC) control groups are typically used to evaluate the consequences of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Whereas CCs match for demographic variables and are readily available, OCs may additionally control for other pre- and post-injury variables but are more costly to recruit. Together, they enable an evaluation of brain-vs general-injury effects. However, the comparability of these two groups and the increase in control over confounding variables when OCs are used has rarely been examined.
   Method: The current study compared samples of CCs (n = 71) and OCs (n = 69), aged between 18-80, on a range of demographic (age, gender, education, socio-economic status), background (medical history, handedness), psychosocial (alcohol use, fatigue, pain, depression, social support, community integration, 'post-concussion' symptoms) and cognitive (motor and processing speed, memory, intellectual ability) variables.
   Results: The two groups were comparable on all variables, except alcohol use, with the OC group having higher levels of alcohol consumption. However, alcohol use did not correlate with any other variable, including commonly used measures of outcome following TBI.
   Conclusion: The current findings suggest that an orthopaedic injury control group does not have any clear advantages over a carefully recruited community control group.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine neurocognitive function associated with chronic nicotine use. A total of 2163 healthy participants (1002 smokers, 1161 never-smoking controls) participated in a population-based case-control design. The main outcome measures were six cognitive domain factors derived from a neuropsychological test battery. In smokers, the battery was administered after controlled smoking of one cigarette. Analyses included age, sex and education as covariates. Results demonstrated small, but significant deficits in smokers for visual attention (P<0.001) and cognitive impulsivity (P<0.006), while verbal episodic memory, verbal fluency, verbal working memory, and Stroop-interference did not differ between groups. These attention/impulsivity deficits were also present in smokers with only a low amount of cigarette consumption. Lifetime nicotine use (pack-years) was not correlated with cognition in smokers. In conclusion, this study confirmed subtle and specific cognitive deficits in non-deprived smokers. The independence of these deficits from consumption intensity may argue for an a priori deficit of some cognitive abilities in smokers. These specific deficits may constitute intermediate phenotypes for genetic research on nicotine use.

ID GENDER-DIFFERENCES; EPISODIC MEMORY
AB Recognition-memory tests reveal individual differences in episodic memory; however, by themselves, these tests provide little information regarding the stage (or stages) in memory processing at which differences are manifested. We used eye-tracking technology, together with a recognition paradigm, to achieve a more detailed analysis of visual processing during encoding and retrieval. Although this approach may be useful for assessing differences in memory across many different populations, we focused on sex differences in face memory. Females outperformed males on recognition-memory tests, and this advantage was directly related to females' scanning behavior at encoding. Moreover, additional exposures to the faces reduced sex differences in face recognition, which suggests that males may be able to improve their recognition memory by extracting more information at encoding through increased scanning. A strategy of increased scanning at encoding may prove to be a simple way to enhance memory performance in other populations with memory impairment.

AB Animal models indicate that exposure to choline in utero improves visual memory through cholinergic transmission and/or epigenetic mechanisms. Among 895 mothers in Project Viva (eastern Massachusetts, 19992002 to 20082011), we estimated the associations between intakes of choline, vitamin B-12, betaine, and folate during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and offspring visual memory (measured by the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, Second Edition (WRAML2), Design and Picture Memory subtests) and intelligence (measured using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2)) at age 7 years. Mean second-trimester intakes were 328 (standard deviation (SD), 63) mg/day for choline, 10.5 (SD, 5.1) g/day for vitamin B-12, 240 (SD, 104) mg/day for betaine, and 1,268 (SD, 381) g/day for folate. Mean age 7 test scores were 17.2 (SD, 4.4) points on the WRAML 2 Design and Picture Memory subtests, 114.3 (SD, 13.9) points on the verbal KBIT-2, and 107.8 (SD, 16.5) points on the nonverbal KBIT-2. In a model adjusting for maternal characteristics, the other nutrients, and childs age and sex, the top quartile of second-trimester choline intake was associated with a child WRAML2 score 1.4 points higher (95 confidence interval: 0.5, 2.4) than the bottom quartile (P-trend 0.003). Results for first-trimester intake were in the same direction but weaker. Intake of the other nutrients was not associated with the cognitive tests administered. Higher gestational choline intake was associated with modestly better child visual memory at age 7 years.

AB The personality traits Openness to experience and Neuroticism of the five-factor model have previously been associated with memory performance in nondemented older adults, but this relationship has not been investigated in samples with memory impairment. Our examination of 50 community-dwelling older adults (29 cognitively intact; 21 with questionable dementia as determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) showed that demographic variables (age, years of education, gender, and estimated premorbid IQ) and current depressive symptoms explained a significant amount of variance of Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status Delayed Memory (adjusted R-2 = 0.23). After controlling for these variables, a measure of global cognitive status further explained a significant portion of variance in memory performance (R-2 =0.13; adjusted R-2 = 0.36; p < .01). Finally, adding Openness to this hierarchical linear regression model explained a significant additional portion of variance (R-2 =0.08; adjusted R-2 = 0.44; p < .01) but adding Neuroticism did not explain any additional variance. This significant relationship between Openness and better memory performance above and beyond one's cognitive status and demographic variables may suggest that a lifelong pattern of involvement in new cognitive activities could be preserved in old age or protect from memory decline. This study suggests that personality may be a powerful predictor of memory ability and clinically useful in this heterogeneous population.

AB Gait impairments are associated with falls and loss of independence. The study of factors associated with poorer gait may assist in developing methods to preserve mobility in older people. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between a range of cognitive functions and gait and gait variability in a population-based sample of older people.
   Gait and intra-individual gait variability measures were obtained using the GAITRite walkway in a sample of older people, aged 6085 years (N 422), randomly selected from the Tasmanian electoral roll. Raw scores from a cognitive battery were subjected to principal component analyses deriving four summary domains: executive function/attention, processing speed, memory, and visuospatial ability. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations between cognitive domains and gait measures adjusting for age, sex, ambulatory activity, medication use, and mood.
   The mean age of the sample was 72.0 years (SD 7.0), with 238 men (56%). Poorer executive function was independently associated with poorer performance in most absolute gait measures and with greater variability in double support phase and step time. Processing speed was associated with absolute gait measures and double support phase variability. Visuospatial ability was only associated with greater double support phase variability, independently of executive function and processing speed. Memory was not independently associated with any gait measure.
   In community-dwelling older people, executive function/attention and processing speed were associated with many aspects of gait, whereas visuospatial ability may only play a role in double support phase variability.

AB This study investigated how different doses of alcohol affected eyewitness recall. Participants (N=126) were randomly assigned to three groups with different blood alcohol concentration (BAC), either a control group (mean BAC 0.00%, N=42), a lower alcohol dose group (mean BAC 0.04%, N=40), or a higher alcohol dose group (mean BAC 0.06%, N=44). After consumption, participants witnessed a movie of a mock crime and were interviewed one week later. The main results showed that witnesses with the higher intoxication level recalled fewer details compared to witnesses with the lower intoxication level. The amount of alcohol consumed did not have an impact on the accuracy rate. No sex differences were found. The results are discussed in the light of past research. We conclude that more studies are needed before recommendations can be made to an applied setting.

AB Introduction: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly those measures associated with a specific white matter pathway, have consistently shown correlations with function. This study sought to investigate correlations between DTI measures in the fornix and common cognitive deficits in MS patients, including episodic memory, working memory and attention.
   Materials and Methods: Patients with MS and group age- and sex-matched controls underwent high-resolution diffusion scanning (1-mm isotropic voxels) and cognitive testing. Manually drawn forniceal regions of interest were applied to individual maps of tensor-derived measures, and mean values of transverse diffusivity (TD), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (LD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated.
   Results: In 40 patients with MS [mean age +/- S.D.-=42.55 +/- 9.1 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) =2.0 +/- 1.2; Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score=0.38 +/- 0.46] and 20 healthy controls (mean age +/- S.D.=41.35 +/- 9.7 years; EDSS=0.0 +/- 0; MSFC score=0.74 +/- 0.24), we found that FA, MD and TO values in the fornix were significantly different between groups (P<.03), and patient performance on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) was correlated with DTI measures (P<.03).
   Discussion: These results are consistent with findings of axonal degeneration in MS and support the use of DTI as an indicator of disease progression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article

ID WORKING-MEMORY; TRAIL
AB Objective We hypothesize that the effect of aging on memory is mediated by executive function.
   Methods Two hundred and thirty healthy adults (101 male, 129 female) were recruited for the study We used a promising, newly developed, computerized neuropsychological test for the measurement of executive function and memory The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and path analysis.
   Results The full mediation model showed a good fit to the data. However, chi-squared (chi(2)) tests for model comparison indicated that the partial mediation model better fits our data. Thus, the partial mediation model was used as the final model. In terms of auditory-verbal memory the effect of aging on memory was fully mediated by executive function. However, visuo-spatial memory was significantly affected both indirectly (through executive function) and directly (by aging). Gender differences were not significant in this model.
   Conclusion This study demonstrated the importance of executive function in the memory functioning of normal aging adults. It is noteworthy that modality differences were found between auditory-verbal and visuo-spatial memory Aging is not the only factor that drives memory decline, and its direct, adverse effect on memory was more prominent in the visuo-spatial memory task than auditory-verbal memory task. Since performance in both modalities is fully or partially mediated by executive function, it is important to train normal aging adults in executive control skills, such as planning, strategy formation, and rapid decision making.

AB Introduction: Cognitive aging is associated with a decline on measures of fluid intelligence (gF), whereas crystallized intelligence (gC) tends to remain stable. In the present study we asked if depressive symptoms might contribute to explain the decline on gF in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults.
   Method: The Norwegian sample included 83 females and 42 males (M = 60, SD = 7.9 years). gF was calculated from factor-analysis, including tests of matrix reasoning (WASI), memory function (CVLT-II), processing speed and executive function (CDT; CWIT). gC was derived from a Vocabulary subtest (WASI). Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-reports on Beck's Depression Index (BDI) and ranged from 0 to 21 (M= 6, SD = 4.5).
   Results: Increased age was correlated with a decline on gF (r = -0.436, p < 0.001), but not gC (r = -0.103, p = ns.). The BDI score in the whole sample was correlated with gF (r = -0.313, p < 0.001). A more detailed analysis showed that the BDI score correlated with measures of both gF and gC in males. The correlations were non-significant for females on all measures, with the exception of a measure of processing speed/executive function. A regression analysis including age and sex in the first step, showed that symptoms of depression significantly contributed to explain decline on gF, F(3, 124) = 16.653, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.292, Delta R-2 = 0.054.
   Discussion: The results showed that symptoms of depression were negatively correlated with cognitive functioning in males even when the symptom-level was below clinical threshold. This indicates that minimal symptoms of depression in older men are clinically relevant to address.

AB Introduction: The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) are widely used in clinical practice. The ROCF assesses visual perception, constructional praxis, and visuo-spatial memory. The FCSRT assesses verbal learning and memory.
   Objective: In this study, as part of the Spanish normative studies project in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults), we present age- and education-adjusted normative data for both tests obtained by using linear regression techniques.
   Material and methods: The sample consisted of 179 healthy participants ranging in age from 18 to 49 years. We provide tables for converting raw scores to scaled scores in addition to tables with scores adjusted by socio-demographic factors.
   Results: The results showed that education affects scores for some of the memory tests and the figure-copying task. Age was only found to have an effect on the performance of visuo-spatial memory tests, and the effect of sex was negligible.
   Conclusions: The normative data obtained will be extremely useful in the clinical neuropsychological evaluation of young Spanish adults. (C) 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have suggested that the ability to remember contextual information related to specific episodic experiences declines with advancing age; however, the exact moment in the adult life span when this deficit begins is still controversial. Source memory for spatial information was tested in a life span sample of 1,500 Adults between the ages of 21 and 80. Initially, images of common objects were randomly presented on one quadrant of a screen while the participants judged whether they were natural or artificial. During the retrieval phase, these same images were mixed with new ones, and all images were displayed in the center of the screen. The participants were asked to judge whether each image was new or old, and whether it was old, to indicate in which quadrant of the screen it had originally been presented. Source accuracy decreased linearly with advancing age at a rate of -0.6% per year Across all decades even after controlling for educational level; this decline was unaffected by sex. These results reveal that either spatial information becomes less efficiently bound to episodic representations over time or that the ability to retrieve this information decreases gradually throughout the adult life span.

AB In the present study, we assessed whether individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show memory impairments for previously performed actions, as previously suggested for people suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Ecker and Engelkamp in Behav Cogn Psychother 23:349-371, 1995; Merckelbach and Wessel in J Nerv Ment Dis 188(12):846-848, 2000). To test this possibility, we explored verbal memory for actions in individuals with a diagnosis of ASD, with and without co-morbidity for OCD, and in controls matched for age and gender. Participants observed or observed and enacted a number of actions while listening to the corresponding phrases being spoken. After a suitable delay, they were submitted to an old/new recognition task. Results showed that ASD individuals with OCD were less accurate and slower in responding compared to ASD individuals without OCD and controls, particularly when dealing with phrases describing simple movements. In contrast, ASD participants without OCD were more impaired when phrases described complex actions that involved pantomiming object use or coordinating movements of multiple body parts. These findings are discussed in terms of differential organization of the motor trace for simple versus complex actions in ASD individuals according to the concurrent presence of OCD.

AB The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was developed to provide a reliable, valid, and standard battery for clinical trials on cognitive enhancers in schizophrenia. In this study we tested the applicability of the MCCB to Singapore's English speakers. Healthy ethnic Chinese, Malay, and Indian English speakers (N = 171) of both genders were recruited within three age groups and three levels of education to match as closely as possible the US norming sample, and were administered the MCCB. Descriptive data, T scores, age, gender, education, and ethnicity effects on performance were explored and compared with the US norming study. Age, education, and ethnicity affected the battery's composite scores, with young and highly educated participants generally outperforming the old, less-educated ones. Male participants outperformed their female counterparts in two out of seven cognitive domains. Although generally lower when compared to the US norming sample, Singaporean scores reflected the same relationship with age, education, and gender, with the exception of a substantially worse performance in the social cognition domain. Differences among the ethnic groups in Singaporeand the poorer performance measured in these groups with respect to the US samplecall for the necessity of an extended norming study in Singapore.

AB Are cognitive sex differences magnified by individual differences in age, sex hormones, or puberty development? Cross-sectional samples of 12- to 14-year-old boys (n=85) and girls (n=102) completed tasks assessing episodic memory, face recognition, verbal fluency, and mental rotations. Blood estradiol, free testosterone, and self-rated puberty scores were obtained. Sex differences were found on all cognitive measures. However, the magnitude was not larger for older children, hormones and cognitive performance were not associated, and early maturers did not perform better than late maturers. Thus, cognitive sex differences were not associated with age, levels of sex hormones, or puberty development.

   CONTEXT; IMPLICIT; TALKER; YOUNG
AB Behavioral studies of spoken word memory have shown that context congruency facilitates both word and source recognition, though the level at which context exerts its influence remains equivocal. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants performed both types of recognition task with words spoken in four voices. Two voice parameters (i.e., gender and accent) varied between speakers, with the possibility that none, one or two of these parameters was congruent between study and test. Results indicated that reinstating the study voice at test facilitated both word and source recognition, compared to similar or no context congruency at test. Behavioral effects were paralleled by two ERP modulations. First, in the word recognition test, the left parietal old/new effect showed a positive deflection reflective of context congruency between study and test words. Namely, the same speaker condition provided the most positive deflection of all correctly identified old words. In the source recognition test, a right frontal positivity was found for the same speaker condition compared to the different speaker conditions, regardless of response success. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the benefit of context congruency is reflected behaviorally and in ERP modulations traditionally associated with recognition memory.

AB Background: Decline in cognitive performance is a highly prevalent health condition in elderly. We studied whether offspring of nonagenarian siblings with a familial history of longevity, perform better on cognitive tests compared to their partners as controls. This is relevant since it could provide insights into determinants underlying decline in cognitive performance.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis within the longitudinal cohort of the Leiden Longevity Study consisting of middle-aged offspring of nonagenarian siblings together with their partners (n = 500, mean age (SD) 66.3 (6.1) and 65.7 (7.2) years, respectively) as controls. Memory function, attention and processing speed were tested using the 15-Picture Learning Test, Stroop test and Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Data were analyzed with regression adjusted for age, gender, years of education and additionally for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, alcohol use, smoking, inflammatory markers and apolipoprotein E genotype. Robust standard errors were used to account for familial relationships among the offspring.
   Results: Cognitive performance was worse at higher calendar age (p<0.001, all except Stroop test part 1). The offspring performed better compared to their partners on trial 3 (p = 0.005), the immediate (p = 0.016) and delayed (p = 0.004) recall of the 15-Picture Learning Test as well as on the interference and combined interference score of the Stroop test (p = 0.014 and p = 0.036, respectively) in the fully adjusted model. The difference between offspring and partners was estimated to be more than three years according to the observed difference in calendar age.
   Conclusions: Offspring of nonagenarian siblings with a familial history of longevity have better cognitive performance compared to the group of their partners of comparable age. This effect is independent of age-related diseases and known possible confounders. Possible explanations might be differences in subclinical vascular pathology between both groups.

AB Associations between genotypes and cognitive outcomes may provide clues as to which mechanisms cause individual differences in old-age cognitive performance. We investigated the effects of five polymorphisms on cognitive functioning in a population-based sample of 2,694 persons without dementia (60-102 years). A structural equation model (SEM) was fit to the cognitive data, yielding five specific latent factors (perceptual speed, episodic memory, semantic memory, category fluency, and letter fluency), as well as a global cognitive factor. These factors showed the expected associations with chronological age. Genotyping was performed for five single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with cognitive performance: APOE (rs429358), COMT (rs4680), BDNF (rs6265), KIBRA (rs17070145), and CLSTN2 (rs6439886). After controlling for age, gender, and education, as well as correcting for multiple comparisons, we observed negative effects of being an APOE epsilon 4 carrier on episodic memory and perceptual speed. Furthermore, being a CLSTN2 TT carrier was associated with poorer semantic memory. For the global factor, the same pattern of results was observed. In addition, being a BDNF any A carrier was associated with better cognitive performance. Also, older age was associated with stronger genetic effects of APOE on global cognition. However, this interaction effect was partly driven by the presence of preclinical dementia cases in our sample. Similarly, excluding future dementia cases attenuated the effects of APOE on episodic memory and global cognition, suggesting that part of the effects of APOE on old-age cognitive performance may be driven by dementia-related processes.

AB Background/Study Context: The goal of the study was to identify and characterize latent profiles (clusters) of cognitive functioning in centenarians and the psychometric properties of cognitive measures within them. Methods: Data were collected from cross-sectional, population-based sample of 244 centenarians (aged 98 to 108, 15.8% men, 20.5% African American, 38.0% community-dwelling) from 44 counties in northern Georgia participating in the Georgia Centenarian Study (20012008). Measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Similarities subtest (WAIS), Hand Tapping, Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME). The Global Deterioration Rating Scale (GDRS) was used to independently evaluate criterion-related validity for distinguishing cognitively normal and impaired groups. Relevant covariates included directly assessed functional status for basic and instrumental activities of daily living (DAFS), race, gender, educational attainment, Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS), and vision and hearing problems. Results: Results suggest two distinct classes of cognitive performance in this centenarian sample. Approximately one third of the centenarians show a pattern of markedly lower cognitive performance on most measures. Group membership is independently well predicted (area under the curve [AUC]=.83) by GDRS scores (sensitivity 67.7%, specificity 82.4%). Membership in the lower cognitive performance group was more likely for individuals who were older, African Americans, had more depressive symptoms, lower plasma folate, carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele, facility residents, and individuals who died in the 2 years following interview. Conclusions: In a population expected to have high prevalence of dementia, latent subtypes can be distinguished via factor mixture analysis that provide normative values for cognitive functioning. The present study allows estimates for normative cognitive performance in this age group.

AB Past research has identified an event-related potential (ERP) marker for vocal emotional encoding and has highlighted vocal-processing differences between male and female listeners. We further investigated this ERP vocal-encoding effect in order to determine whether it predicts voice-related changes in listeners' memory for verbal interaction content. Additionally, we explored whether sex differences in vocal processing would affect such changes. To these ends, we presented participants with a series of neutral words spoken with a neutral or a sad voice. The participants subsequently encountered these words, together with new words, in a visual word recognition test. In addition to making old/new decisions, the participants rated the emotional valence of each test word. During the encoding of spoken words, sad voices elicited a greater P200 in the ERP than did neutral voices. While the P200 effect was unrelated to a subsequent recognition advantage for test words previously heard with a neutral as compared to a sad voice, the P200 did significantly predict differences between these words in a concurrent late positive ERP component. Additionally, the P200 effect predicted voice-related changes in word valence. As compared to words studied with a neutral voice, words studied with a sad voice were rated more negatively, and this rating difference was larger, the larger the P200 encoding effect was. While some of these results were comparable in male and female participants, the latter group showed a stronger P200 encoding effect and qualitatively different ERP responses during word retrieval. Estrogen measurements suggested the possibility that these sex differences have a genetic basis.

AB The present study examines memory for social-exchange-relevant information. In Experiment 1 male and female faces were shown together with behaviour descriptions of cheating, altruistic, and neutral behaviour. Previous results have led to the hypothesis that people preferentially remember schema-atypical information. Given the common gender stereotype that women are kinder and less egoistic than men, this atypicality account would predict that source memory (that is, memory for the type of context to which a face was associated) should be enhanced for female cheaters in comparison to male cheaters. The results of Experiment 1 confirmed this hypothesis. Experiment 2 reveals that source memory for female faces associated with disgusting behaviours is enhanced in comparison to male faces associated with disgusting behaviours. Thus the atypicality effect generalises beyond social-exchange-relevant information, a result which is inconsistent with the assumption that the findings can be ascribed to a highly specific cheater detection module.

AB The current study examined the role of the hippocampus in emotional memory encoding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present study examined the activation patterns of 12 healthy participants who were associated with memory for words and pictures with moderately high emotional tone. Results revealed significant activation in the temporal and frontal lobes for emotional and neutral stimuli. There was greater activation in the left hippocampus for emotional words and the right hippocampus for emotional pictures. However, a separate analysis of gender suggested that the emotional responses of the women accounted for the activation of the hippocampus; men did not have a pattern of hippocampus activation consistent with the type of stimuli. These findings have important implications for the design of a clinical memory assessment using fMRI.

AB Background. Studies concerning the effect of different types of leisure activities on various cognitive domains are limited. This study tests the hypothesis that mental, physical, and social activities have a domain-specific protection against cognitive decline.
   Methods. A cohort of a geographically defined population in China was examined in 2003-2005 and followed for an average of 2.4 years. Leisure activities were assessed in 1,463 adults aged 65 years and older without cognitive or physical impairment at baseline, and their cognitive performances were tested at baseline and follow-up examinations.
   Results. High level of mental activity was related to less decline in global cognition (beta = -.23, p < .01), language (beta = -.11, p < .05), and executive function (beta = -.13, p < .05) in ANCOVA models adjusting for age, gender, education, history of stroke, body mass index, Apolipoprotein E genotype, and baseline cognition. High level of physical activity was related to less decline in episodic memory (beta = -.08, p < .05) and language (beta = -.15, p < .01). High level of social activity was associated with less decline in global cognition (beta = -.11, p < .05). Further, a dose-response pattern was observed: although participants who did not engage in any of the three activities experienced a significant global cognitive decline, those who engaged in any one of the activities maintained their cognition, and those who engaged in two or three activities improved their cognition. The same pattern was observed in men and in women.
   Conclusions. Leisure activities in old age may protect against cognitive decline for both women and men, and different types of activities seem to benefit different cognitive domains.

AB We have examined the influence of sex and the perceived emotional nature of learned information on pre-learning stress-induced alterations of long-term memory. Participants submerged their dominant hand in ice cold (stress) or warm (no stress) water for 3 min. Thirty minutes later, they studied 30 words, rated the words for their levels of emotional valence and arousal and were then given an immediate free recall test. Twenty-four hours later, participants' memory for the word list was assessed via delayed free recall and recognition assessments. The resulting memory data were analyzed after categorizing the studied words (i.e., distributing them to "positive-arousing", "positive-non-arousing", "negative-arousing", etc. categories) according to participants' valence and arousal ratings of the words. The results revealed that participants exhibiting a robust cortisol response to stress exhibited significantly impaired recognition memory for neutral words. More interestingly, however, males displaying a robust cortisol response to stress demonstrated significantly impaired recall, overall, and a marginally significant impairment of overall recognition memory, while females exhibiting a blunted cortisol response to stress demonstrated a marginally significant impairment of overall recognition memory. These findings support the notion that a brief stressor that is temporally separated from learning can exert deleterious effects on long-term memory. However, they also suggest that such effects depend on the sex of the organism, the emotional salience of the learned information and the degree to which stress increases corticosteroid levels.

AB Source memory for the speaker's voice (male or female) was investigated when semantic knowledge (gender stereotypes) could and could not inform the episodic source judgment while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Source accuracy was greater and response times were faster when stereotypes could predict the speaker's voice at test. Recollection supported source judgments in both conditions as indicated by significant parietal "old/new" ERP effects (500-800 ms). Prototypical late ERP effects (the right frontal "old/new" effect and the late posterior negativity, LPN) were evident when source judgment was based solely on episodic memory. However, these two late ERP effects were diminished and a novel, frontal-negative ERP with left-central topography was observed when stereotypes aided source judgments. This pattern of ERP activity likely reflects activation of left frontal or left temporal lobes when semantic knowledge, in the form of a gender stereotype, is accessed to inform the episodic source judgment.

AB Background: Cognitive impairments are seen in first psychotic episode (FEP) patients. The neurobiological underpinnings that might underlie these changes remain unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels are associated with cognitive impairment in FEP patients compared with healthy controls.
   Methods: 45 FEP patients and 45 healthy controls matched by age, gender and educational level were selected from the Basque Country area of Spain. Plasma BDNF levels were assessed in healthy controls and in patients. A battery of cognitive tests was applied to both groups, with the patients being assessed at 6 months after the acute episode and only in those with a clinical response to treatment.
   Results: Plasma BDNF levels were altered in patients compared with the control group. In FEP patients, we observed a positive association between BDNF levels at six months and five cognitive domains (learning ability, immediate and delayed memory, abstract thinking and processing speed) which persisted after controlling for medications prescribed, drug use, intelligence quotient (IQ) and negative symptoms. In the healthy control group, BDNF levels were not associated with cognitive test scores.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that BDNF is associated with the cognitive impairment seen after a FEP. Further investigations of the role of this neurotrophin in the symptoms associated with psychosis onset are warranted.

AB Insulin resistance increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, but higher insulin levels may be cognitively protective after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of peripheral insulin as a predictor of cognitive decline both before and after an AD diagnosis needs further elucidation. We studied 197 AD cases and 198 normal controls enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium. Standardized protocols were used to collect age, gender, education, body mass index (BMI), serum insulin (not restricted to fasting), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipids, smoking and cardiovascular disease history, and neuropsychological tests including Mini-Mental State Examination, American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART) errors, Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT), Boston Naming Test, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMSR) Digit Span, Trails A and B, WMSR Logical Memory (LM) I and II, and Visual Reproduction (VR) I and II. We used linear regression to test the contribution of log-transformed serum insulin to each score, adjusting for age, gender, education, and BMI. In the AD cases, higher serum insulin was associated with worse performance on the COWAT (p < 0.001) and Trails B (p = 0.04). In controls, higher serum insulin was associated with worse performance on the AMNART (p = 0.001), COWAT (p = 0.007), Digit Span (p = 0.004), LM I (p = 0.004), LM II (p = 0.009), and marginally with VR II (p = 0.076). Adjustment for HbA1c, APOE4, and cardiovascular disease, or restricting the sample to mild AD, did not alter these associations. In non-demented older individuals, higher peripheral insulin appears to be associated with worse cognitive performance in multiple domains, but is not a consistent predictor in AD cases. These findings indicate the need for additional research on the role of insulin in the transition between normal and impaired cognitive function.

AB Over 100,000 verbal and visuospatial immediate and delayed memory tests were presented via the Internet to over 28,000 participants in the age range of 11 to 80. Structural equation modeling pointed to the verbal versus visuospatial dimension as an important factor in individual differences, but not the immediate versus delayed dimension. We found a linear decrease of 1% to 3% per year in overall memory performance past the age of 25. For visuospatial tests, this decrease started at age 18 and was twice as fast as the decrease of verbal memory. There were strong effects of education, with the highest educated group sometimes scoring one full standard deviation above the lowest educated group. Gender effects were small but as expected: women outperformed men on the verbal memory tasks; men outperformed women on the visuospatial tasks. We also found evidence of increasing proneness to false memory with age. Memory for recent news events did not show a decrease with age. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE-To examine whether type 2 diabetes is associated with microstructural abnormalities in specific cerebral white matter tracts and to relate these microstructural abnormalities to cognitive functioning.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Thirty-five nondemented older individuals with type 2 diabetes (mean age 71 +/- 5 years) and 35 age-, sex-, and education-matched control subjects underwent a 3 Tesla diffusion-weighted MRI scan and a detailed cognitive assessment. Tractography was performed to reconstruct several white matter tracts. Diffusion tensor imaging measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were compared between groups and related to cognitive performance.
   RESULTS-MD was significantly increased in all tracts in both hemispheres in patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.05), reflecting microstructural white matter abnormalities in the diabetes group. Increased MD was associated with slowing of information-processing speed and worse memory performance in the diabetes but not in the control group after adjustment for age, sex, and estimated IQ (group x MD interaction, all P < 0.05). These associations were independent of total white matter hyperintensity load and presence of cerebral infarcts.
   CONCLUSIONS-Individuals with type 2 diabetes showed microstructural abnormalities in various white matter pathways. These abnormalities were related to worse cognitive functioning. Diabetes Care 36: 137-144, 2013

AB Background: Social networks and support have been proposed as cognitively protective in old age. As studies often consider these social factors in isolation the question of which characteristics of the social environment are beneficial remains. Objective:The current study examined associations between measures of social networks (including contact with friends/family, marital status and living arrangement), feelings of loneliness and social support, and a range of cognitive outcomes. Methods: Social network, loneliness and support data were available in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936, n = 1,091) at age 70. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, and factor scores were available for general cognitive ability, and the cognitive domains of processing speed and memory. Childhood cognitive ability data from age 11 were also available. Results: When examined in separate ANCOVAs, lower loneliness and more social support were significantly associated with better cognitive abilities at age 70, though not memory (independently of age, sex, childhood cognitive ability and social class), accounting for about 0.5-1.5% of the variance. When the social factors were considered simultaneously, higher loneliness remained associated with lower general cognitive ability (eta(2)(p) = 0.005, p = 0.046), and those living alone (eta(2)(p) = 0.007, p = 0.014) or with less social support (eta(2)(p) = 0.007, p = 0.016) had slower processing speed. When these final models were repeated including a depression symptoms score as a covariate, the associations between loneliness and general cognitive ability, and social support and processing speed, were no longer significant. However, the association between living alone and processing speed remained (eta(2)(p) = 0.006, p = 0.031). Conclusions: Of the social factors considered, loneliness, social support and living arrangement were most consistently associated with aspects of cognitive ability in older people, and these associations appeared to be partly, though not wholly, accounted for by symptoms of depression. Although longitudinal follow-up is required to examine the causal direction of the effects more definitively, it may be beneficial to promote the development of interventions to reduce loneliness and social isolation, and to increase social support.

AB Aims: Metabolic disturbances may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated the relation between cognitive impairment and metabolic deteriorations, low physical fitness, low-grade inflammation and abdominal obesity in middle aged individuals.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 40 to 65 year-old patients with type 2 diabetes and limited co morbidity (N = 56), age-matched individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (N = 56) as well as age-matched controls with normal glucose tolerance (N = 72). Specific cognitive functions were assessed with focus on verbal memory, processing speed, executive functions, and a composite overall mean score. Oral glucose tolerance test, VO(2)max test, systemic inflammation, DXA scanning and abdominal MRI were measured.
   Results: Multiple linear regression analyses adjusting for age, gender and verbal intelligence demonstrated that a low score in processing speed, executive functions and overall cognitive function were related to high fasting C-peptide, as well as low insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and VO(2)max. Measurements of blood glucose, obesity and inflammation were not associated with cognitive function.
   Conclusion: Low cognitive scores are seen in middle aged individuals with hyperinsulinemia, low insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and low aerobic capacity. These findings emphasize the importance of appropriate lifestyle and not only blood glucose control in prevention of cognitive disability.

AB Compared with nonarousing stimuli, arousing stimuli enhance memory performance. The most robust effects have been reported for negative stimuli, "the negativity effect," although a number of mediating factors prevent definitive conclusions, for example, age, gender, memory task, retention period, and alternative arousal measures. To clarify whether the negativity effect is robust across age, gender, and time, we studied incidental recognition of neutral and negative pictures from the International Affective Picture System (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999) in healthy younger and older adults-women and men-after a 1-year retention interval. Memory performance was related to 2 arousal measures at encoding, skin conductance response (SCR), and intensity rating of unpleasantness. The results showed weaker overall memory performance for older adults compared with younger adults. The negativity effect on accuracy (d') was gender dependent and age independent. In contrast, the negativity effect on response bias (c) interacted with age, but not gender, being weaker for older adults. Despite significant differences in arousal (SCR and arousal rating) between negative and neutral pictures, the correlations between arousal measures and memory performance were weak. Controlling for age and gender, a small negative partial correlation was found between arousal ratings and accuracy. The results extend previous studies by relating long-term recognition to both age and gender as well as to arousal at encoding.

AB Primary objective: To investigate differences between individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a control group regarding quantitative characteristics of narrative discourse including correct information units (CIUs). The secondary objective was to explore cognitive correlations with narrative discourse measurements.
   Research design: Case-control study.
   Methods: Twenty-six individuals with TBI and 24 age-, gender- and education-matched subjects without brain injury were examined. Four-frame comic strips were used for elicitation of narrative discourse. Six variables of discourse measurements (total time, total number of units and CIUs, units per time, CIUs per time and CIUs per unit) were calculated. The relationships between the 6 discourse measurements and results of standard cognitive tests were also examined, including logical memory, working memory and executive functions.
   Main outcomes and results: The time efficiency for narrative discourse (i.e. total time, units per time and CIUs per time) was significantly decreased in the TBI group. Moreover, time efficiency was significantly related to measurements of working memory and executive function. The TBI group did not differ from the control group with regard to total number of units and CIUs and CIUs per unit.
   Conclusion: Decreased time efficiency is the most critical characteristic of narrative discourse in individuals with TBI.

AB Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most frequent of the inherited ataxias. However, very few studies have examined the cognitive status of patients with genetically defined FRDA. Our aim was to study cognitive performance of FRDA patients taking into account the motor problems characteristic of this clinical population. Thirty-six FRDA patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery measuring multiple domains: processing speed, attention, working memory, executive functions, verbal and visual memory, visuoperceptive and visuospatial skills, visuoconstructive functions, and language. Thirty-one gender, age, years of education, and estimated IQ-matched healthy participants served as control subjects. All participants were native Spanish speakers. Patients showed decreased motor and mental speed, problems in conceptual thinking, a diminished verbal fluency, deficits in acquisition of verbal information and use of semantic strategies in retrieval, visuoperceptive and visuoconstructive problems, and poor action naming. Scores on the depression inventory were significantly higher in patients than controls, but depression did not account for group differences in cognitive performance. The observed pattern of neuropsychological impairment is indicative of executive problems and parieto-temporal dysfunction. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies with FRDA patients have reported only mild anomalies in cerebral hemispheres. Thus, cognitive impairment in FRDA is probably caused by the interruption of the cerebro-cerebellar circuits that have been proposed as the anatomical substrate of the cerebellar involvement in cognition.

AB Population ageing is rapidly becoming a global issue and will have a major impact on health policies and programmes. The World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) aims to address the gap in reliable data and scientific knowledge on ageing and health in low- and middle-income countries. SAGE is a longitudinal study with nationally representative samples of persons aged 50+ years in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa, with a smaller sample of adults aged 18-49 years in each country for comparisons. Instruments are compatible with other large high-income country longitudinal ageing studies. Wave 1 was conducted during 2007-2010 and included a total of 34 124 respondents aged 50+ and 8340 aged 18-49. In four countries, a subsample consisting of 8160 respondents participated in Wave 1 and the 2002/04 World Health Survey (referred to as SAGE Wave 0). Wave 2 data collection will start in 2012/13, following up all Wave 1 respondents. Wave 3 is planned for 2014/15. SAGE is committed to the public release of study instruments, protocols and meta- and micro-data: access is provided upon completion of a Users Agreement available through WHO's SAGE website (www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sage) and WHO's archive using the National Data Archive application (http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/surveydata).

AB Background: The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) has been validated for detecting dementia in English-speaking populations. However, no studies have examined the Chinese version of the HVLT scale, and appropriate cut-off scores for dementia in the Chinese population remain unclear.
   Methods: 631 subjects aged 60 and over were recruited at a memory clinic at Dongzhimen Hospital in Beijing. Of these, 249 were classified as exhibiting normal cognition (NC), 134 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 97 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 met the diagnosis for vascular dementia (VaD), and 50 were diagnosed with other types of dementia, including mixed dementia. The discriminative capacity of the HVLT total learning score, recognition score and total score were calculated to determine their sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI, AD and other dementias, and various cut-off scores.
   Results: HVLT scores were affected by age, education and sex. The HVLT total learning score exhibited an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity using a cut-off score of 15.5 for distinguishing AD and other types of dementia from NC using the ROC curve, with sensitivity of 94.7% for distinguishing AD and all types of dementia, and specificity of 92.5% for detecting AD and 93.4% for detecting all types of dementias. We stratified the AD and MCI groups by age, and calculated the validity in each age group. In the 50-64 years age group, when the cutoff score was 18.5, the sensitivity of 0.955 and specificity of 0.921 were obtained for discriminating the NC and AD groups, and in the 65-80 years group, and optimal sensitivity and specificity values (0.948 and 0.925, respectively) were obtained with a cutoff score of 14.5.
   When the cutoff score was 21.5 in HVLT total recall, an optimal balance was obtained between sensitivity and specificity (69.1% and 70.7%, respectively) in distinguishing MCI from NC.
   Conclusion: A cut-off score of 15.5 in the HVLT total learning score led to high discriminative capacity between the dementia and NC groups. This suggests that the HVLT total learning score can provide a useful tool for discriminating dementia, but not MCI, from NC in clinical and epidemiological practice.

AB Objectives: Various strands of evidence suggest that low intake of omega-3 fatty acids increases risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The present study investigated differences in dietary intake and blood plasma content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in individuals with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy volunteers (HV).
   Methods: A total of 135 individuals aged between 55 and 91 years (19 AD, 55 CIND, and 61 HV) were assessed predominantly within a hospital setting.
   Results: Compared with age and sex-matched HV, individuals with AD or CIND performed poorly on a majority of tests of cognitive function. Impairment was greatest for delayed and verbal recognition memory. CIND individuals were less impaired than AD individuals. Omega-3 intake and the percentage of EPA and DHA in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) showed a similar pattern (AD < HV, with intermediate scores for CIND). Across the whole sample, and after controlling for age, years of education, level of socio-economic deprivation, and gender, omega-3 intake, plasma PC DHA, and plasma PC EPA were all significant positive predictors of memory functioning.
   Discussion: These results are consistent with the possibility that omega-3 fatty acid nutrition has an impact on cognitive decline, but could equally be explained by dietary changes that occurred after onset of cognitive decline. It is also possible that the results could be explained by unknown confounding factors.

AB Relatively little is known about differences in English-administered, clinical neuropsychological test performance between native versus non-native English speakers, with prior literature yielding mixed findings. The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of native and non-native English speakers with similar age and educational backgrounds on a variety of cognitive tests. Participants were 153 university students (115 native and 38 non-native English speakers) who completed a neuropsychological battery during two testing sessions. Multiple regression analyses examined relations of native language to cognitive performance after adjustment for age, education, sex, and depressive symptomatology. Results showed that native English speakers outperformed non-native English speakers on several language-mediated tasksLetter and Category Fluency and the Cognitive Estimation Testas well as Trails A (ps .05). The two groups performed similarly on tests of executive functions, perceptuo-motor speed, verbal memory, and visuospatial abilities. These results suggest that non-native English language may have a negative influence predominantly on language-dependent tasks.

TI Mediating Effects of Processing Speed and Executive Functions in

AB Objective: Age differences in episodic memory (memory) have been attributed to a general reduction in processing speed (the "speed mediation hypothesis"), but also to declines in the efficiency of executive functions operations ("executive decline hypothesis"). To test predictions from these competing models, we examined the mediating effects of processing speed (speed) and executive functions (executive) on age and episodic memory in three older adult cohorts. Method: The first sample comprised 842 individuals from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS). The second and third samples included 476 individuals from the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS), with each twin from a pair randomly assigned to form two samples. A series of regression analyses was performed on each of the three samples independently, so as to obtain the sizes and statistical significances of the indirect effects of age on each of the memory variables, mediated by each of the Executive and Speed composites. Sex was a control variable for all analyses. Analyses were repeated with current depression as an additional control variable. Results: Data from the MAS sample suggested that both Speed and Executive composites were significant mediators, with the former having a stronger mediation effect. A similar pattern was found in the two OATS samples. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with those of previous studies in which speed had a stronger mediating effect than executive on age-related variation in memory. They provide further support for the speed mediation hypothesis, although not negating the executive decline hypothesis.

DT Article
ID MEMORY; INFORMATION
AB 52 secondary school students from the Chaoshan, China, area, where males are highly valued, were examined for self-reference, mother-reference, and father-reference effects. Because the father is the primary role model in Chaoshan culture, it was predicted that male participants would demonstrate a father-reference effect while females would show a mother-reference effect. The results confirmed that females showed significant self-, mother-, and father-reference effects in terms of memory performance, while males showed only a significant father-reference effect and a marginally significant self-reference effect. This study highlights the importance of researching subcultures such as the Chaoshan subculture to gain a comprehensive understanding of self-construct.

AB Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder characterised by short stature, facial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects and mildly lowered intellectual abilities. Research has mainly focused on genetic and somatic aspects, while intellectual and cognitive functioning has been documented scarcely. Also, to date studies have been primarily performed in children. This is the first study in which functioning within the major cognitive domains is systematically evaluated in a group of adults with NS and compared with a control group. Extensive neuropsychological assessment, including the domains intelligence, speed of information processing, memory (working memory, immediate recall and delayed recall), executive function and visuoconstruction, was performed in a sample of 42 patients with NS and 42 healthy controls, matched on age, sex and education level. In addition, subjective cognitive complaints were assessed with self-report questionnaires. On the domain speed of information processing patients performed worse than controls (P?<?0.05). Furthermore, except for slightly better results on delayed recall in the patients with NS (P?<?0.05), none of the other cognitive domains showed between-group differences. On the questionnaires, patients reported substantially more complaints about their own cognitive abilities than controls (P?<?0.05). A lowered speed of information processing and relatively intact functioning in other cognitive domains characterises the cognitive profile of adult patients, in contrast to previous findings in children with NS, who seem to have more generalised cognitive deficits.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare neuropsychological functions in moderately preterm (32-35 weeks' gestation) and full-term children at the age of 7 years and identify gender differences.
   METHODS: Community-based prospective cohort study of 248 moderately preterm children (138 boys) and 130 full-term children (58 boys). Neuropsychological tests included IQ, memory, attention, visual perception, motor skills, visuomotor skills, and parental report of executive functioning.
   RESULTS: The moderately preterm group performed significantly worse on total and performance IQ, visuospatial reasoning, attention control, inhibition, and executive functioning. No differences were found in verbal IQ, verbal memory, and visuomotor and motor skills. Preterm children were at higher risk for scores <10th percentile on intelligence, visuospatial reasoning (relative risk ratio both: 1.69 [95% confidence interval: 1.29-2.28]), and executive functioning problems (relative risk: 1.94 [95% confidence interval: 1.51-2.57]). Using gender-specific norms, preterm boys performed significantly worse than fullterm boys on visuospatial reasoning (P < .01); preterm girls performed significantly worse than full-term girls on visuospatial reasoning, intelligence, attention, and executive functioning (P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Moderately preterm birth is associated with lower intelligence and poorer neuropsychological functioning at early school age. No differences in motor skills and verbal memory were found. Using gender-specific norms, our data suggest that moderately preterm boys catch up, whereas moderately preterm girls lag behind their peers on various neuropsychological functions by the age of 7 years.

AB van der Werf M, Kohler S, Verkaaik M, Verhey F, van Os J, GROUP Investigators. Cognitive functioning and age at onset in non-affective psychotic disorder. Objective: Age at psychosis onset has been related to variability in cognitive functioning, but its effect may be mediated by demographic and clinical factors. The aim of the current study was to study the contribution of age at onset, as well as demographic and illness characteristics, to variation in cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Method: Patients (n = 1053) and healthy controls (n = 631) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical assessments. The effect of age at onset on age-standardized cognitive test scores was assessed with multiple linear regression analyses. Mediation by illness and demographic factors was tested using a multiple mediation Sobel test. Results: A diagnosis of schizophrenia, higher antipsychotic dose, and more negative symptoms were associated with earlier onset of illness, while female sex and a more chronic course were associated with later illness onset. Furthermore, earlier onset was associated with worse performance on immediate recall and sustained attention. However, male sex, more negative symptoms, and higher antipsychotic dose mediated the effect of age at onset on memory, while negative symptoms explained its association with attention/vigilance. Conclusion: Greater impairment in memory and attention in early-onset psychosis may be explained by features indicative of underlying neurodevelopmental vulnerability.

AB Purpose: To investigate cognitive function in patients with early and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with an elderly, community-dwelling Korean population without AMD.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Participants: We enrolled 170 AMD patients and 190 non-AMD community-based controls.
   Methods: A comprehensive battery for cognitive function evaluation consisting of 15 psychological tests, including a depression evaluation test, was used. Cognitive function scores were adjusted for age, gender, education, and visual acuity (VA). We categorized AMD as early AMD, exudative AMD, or geographic atrophy.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the degree of cognitive impairment, as assessed by the Korean versions of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery, Benton Visual Retention Test, and Digit Span Test Forward and Backward.
   Results: Patients with AMD showed lower global cognition scores than did normal controls (mean Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 24.97 vs 25.99; P<0.001). Among cognitive functions, visuospatial function, verbal memory, visual memory, and frontal function were impaired in AMD patients relative to normal controls. The rate of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was higher in AMD patients than in controls (52.4% vs 26.8%; P<0.001), with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.127 (95% confidence interval, 1.855-5.271) after adjustment for age, education, and VA. Geographic atrophy was associated with the highest risk of MCI (OR, 4.431; 95% confidence interval, 1.413-13.898) and a clinically significant reduction in MMSE scores (23.42) relative to the controls. There was a trend of worsening cognitive function test scores from the controls to the early AMD, then the exudative AMD, and finally the geographic atrophy patients, after adjustment for covariates. AMD patients with poor VA (<= 20/100) had 6 times the risk of MCI as AMD patients with good or moderate VA (>20/100).
   Conclusions: Patients with AMD, especially those with the geographic atrophy subtype, are at greater risk for cognitive impairment than are non-AMD control subjects. In the visual rehabilitation of AMD patients, potential cognitive impairment should be taken into consideration.

AB Individual differences in face recognition are often contrasted with differences in object recognition using a single object category. Likewise, individual differences in perceptual expertise for a given object domain have typically been measured relative to only a single category baseline. In Experiment 1, we present a new test of object recognition, the Vanderbilt Expertise Test (VET), which is comparable in methods to the Cambridge Face Memory Task (CFMT) but uses eight different object categories. Principal component analysis reveals that the underlying structure of the VET can be largely explained by two independent factors, which demonstrate good reliability and capture interesting sex differences inherent in the VET structure. In Experiment 2, we show how the VET can be used to separate domain-specific from domain-general contributions to a standard measure of perceptual expertise. While domain-specific contributions are found for car matching for both men and women and for plane matching in men, women in this sample appear to use more domain-general strategies to match planes. In Experiment 3, we use the VET to demonstrate that holistic processing of faces predicts face recognition independently of general object recognition ability, which has a sex-specific contribution to face recognition. Overall, the results suggest that the VET is a reliable and valid measure of object recognition abilities and can measure both domain-general skills and domain-specific expertise, which were both found to depend on the sex of observers.

AB Introduction: Retrospective studies and case reports suggest an association between coeliac disease and impaired cognitive function.
   Aim: To evaluate functional and cognitive performances in coeliac disease vs. control patients older than 65 years.
   Method: Eighteen coeliac disease patients (75 4 years, group A) on gluten free diet since 5.5 +/- 3 years and 18 age-sex matched controls (76 4 years, group B) were studied using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results of functional and cognitive tests are expressed as "row scores" and as "equivalent scores" by relating "raw scores" to reference rank categories.
   Results: Barthel Index of functional performance was similar in the 2 groups. "Raw score" was significantly lower in coeliac disease than controls for Mini Mental Test Examination (p = 0.02), Trail Making Test (p = 0.001), Semantic Fluency (p = 0.03), Digit Symbol Test (p = 0.007), Ideo-motor apraxia (p < 0.001) and Bucco-facial apraxia (p < 0.002). "Equivalent score" was also lower in coeliac disease than controls for Semantic memory (p < 0.01) and for Ideo-motor apraxia (p = 0.007).
   Conclusion: Cognitive performance is worse in elderly coeliac disease than control patients, despite prolonged gluten avoidance in coeliacs. Awareness on the increasing phenomenon of late-onset coeliac disease is important to minimize diagnostic delay and prolonged exposure to gluten that may adversely and irreversibly affect cognitive function.

AB Objective: Elevated body mass index (BMI) at midlife is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in later life. The goal of the current study was to assess mechanisms of early brain vulnerability by examining if higher BMI at midlife affects current cognitive performance through alterations in cerebral neurochemistry. Methods: Fifty-five participants, aged 40 to 60 years, underwent neuropsychological testing, health screen, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy examining N-acetylaspartate, creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (ml), choline, and glutamate concentrations in occipitoparietal gray matter. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, choline, ml, and glutamate were calculated as a ratio over Cr and examined in relation to BMI using multivariate regression analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine if BMI had an indirect effect on cognition through cerebral metabolite levels. Results: Higher BMI was associated with elevations in ml/Cr (F(5,45) = 3.843, p = .006, beta = 0.444, p = .002), independent of age, sex, fasting glucose levels, and systolic blood pressure. Moreover, a chi(2) difference test of the direct and indirect structural equation models revealed that BM I had an indirect effect on global cognitive performance (Delta chi(2) = 19.939, df = 2, p < .001). Subsequent follow-up analyses revealed that this effect was specific to memory (Delta chi(2) = 22.027, df = 2, p < .001). Conclusions: Higher BMI was associated with elevations in ml/Cr concentrations in the occipitoparietal gray matter and indirectly related to poorer memory performance through ml/Cr levels, potentially implicating plasma hypertonicity and neuroinflammation as mechanisms underlying obesity-related brain vulnerability.

AB Cognitive aging processes are underpinned by multiple processes including genetic factors. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to be involved in age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy individuals. The gender-specific role of the BDNF gene in cognitive aging remains unclear. The identification of genetic biomarkers might be a useful approach to identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline during healthy aging processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BDNF gene and domains of cognitive functioning in normal cognitive aging. The sample, comprising 369 participants (M = 72.7 years, SD = 4.45 years), completed an extensive neuropsychological test battery measuring memory, motor function, and perceptual speed. The relationships between the SNPs rs6265, rs7103411, and rs7124442 and cognitive domains were examined. While significant main effects of BDNF SNPs on cognitive function were found for the association between rs7103411 and memory performance, gender-specific analyses revealed for females significant main effects of rs7103411 for memory and of rs6265 for perceptual speed independent of the APOE*E4 status and education. The finding for the association between rs6265 and perceptual speed in females remained significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. None of the analyses showed significant results for males. This study is the first to implicate that the SNPs rs6265 and rs7103411 affect cognitive function in the elderly in a gender-specific way.

AB Perceptual narrowing in the visual, auditory, and multisensory domains has its developmental origins during infancy. The current study shows that experimentally induced experience can reverse the effects of perceptual narrowing on infants' visual recognition memory of other-race faces. Caucasian 8- to 10-month-olds who could not discriminate between novel and familiarized Asian faces at the beginning of testing were given brief daily experience with Asian female faces in the experimental condition and Caucasian female faces in the control condition. At the end of 3 weeks, only infants who received daily experience with Asian females showed above-chance recognition of novel Asian female and male faces. Furthermore, infants in the experimental condition showed greater efficiency in learning novel Asian females compared with infants in the control condition. Thus, visual experience with a novel stimulus category can reverse the effects of perceptual narrowing during infancy via improved stimulus recognition and encoding. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Current research suggests that emotional responses differ between men and women. Sex differences regarding emotional effects on memory have been recently studied through brain imaging techniques. However, the majority of investigations have often neglected to balance the variable of emotional intensity (arousal) across pleasant and unpleasant pictures. Additionally, men and women were often mixed or studied separately. The current study aims at comparing men and women's electrophysiological responses related to emotional memory of photographic material. These responses were measured using Event Related brain Potentials (ERP) in response to a task of episodic memory of emotional images. The frontal N200, the parietal P300 and the central LPC were compared in 17 men and 17 women matched for age, social economic status, education and intelligence. Behavioral results showed that, in men, reaction times were modulated by valence, whereas for women, reaction times were mainly modulated by arousal. Accuracy was affected by both emotional valence and arousal, but only in women. ERP analyses revealed that emotional valence influenced earlier time components (frontal N200 and parietal P300), whereas arousal influenced memory in the later time component (central LPC). Moreover, sex differences, mediated by valence and arousal, were found in ERP responses at different times in the processing stream. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes sex differences in spatial competencies among the Hadza, a mobile hunter gatherer population in Tanzania. It addresses the following questions: (a) Is the usual male advantage in Euclidean spatial abilities found in this population, where both women and men are highly mobile? (b) Do Hadza women have better object location memory than men, as the gathering hypothesis predicts? (c) Do women who are nominated by others as being good at finding bushfoods excel at the object location memory task? We tested object location memory with a version of the memory game using cards of local plants and animals. This allowed us to also ask whether women and men would have better spatial memory for the plant and animal cards, respectively. We found that Hadza men were significantly better than women in three tests of spatial ability: the water-level test, targeting, and the ability to point accurately to distant locations (the latter only in the less mobile groups). There was a trend toward a male advantage at the object location memory task, in contrast to results found previously in nonforaging populations, and women's performance at the task deteriorated with age, while that of men did not. The women who were nominated by peers as being good at finding bushfoods were consistently older women. We discuss the probable hormonal causes and functional consequences of age changes in the spatial competencies of female foragers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tactile acuity measured by 2-point discrimination performance is impaired in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). This is mirrored by pain-associated shrinkage of the cortical representation of the affected limb. We investigated whether, also, more complex tactile performance assessed by a dynamic 2D-form perception task is disturbed in CRPS-I patients. Therefore, we developed a Braille-like recognition task (BT) for geometrical dot pattern identification by dynamic touch. We studied 47 healthy volunteers (Study I) and compared them to 16 CRPS-I patients (Study II). Besides recognition time and error quote of the BT, we assessed static 2-point discrimination thresholds (TPDT). In healthy subjects, the performance in the BT correlated significantly with age and TPDT. In CRPS patients, TPDT was significantly increased on the affected side compared to sex-and age-matched controls from study I (2.98 +/- 0.84 mm vs 2.05 +/- 0.82 mm, P < 0.01). The performance in the BT was not impaired in CRPS-I patients (compared to sex- and age-matched controls from study I) and was not correlated to the TPDT. The intact 2D-form recognition ability in CRPS-I patients might be explained by intact dynamic tactile and proprioceptive functions, which appear to be uncompromised by the impaired static tactile perception, provided that the spacing of the dot pattern is above the individual tactile acuity. These intact 2D-form perception capacities may also be related to higher sensory integration functions like the visual system and intact semantic understanding, which may be spared by the cortical reorganization phenomena in CRPS-I.

AB Background: Schizophrenia shows gender differences in patients' clinical presentation, neurocognitive impairment, course, and treatment outcome. The aims of this study were to compare gender differences in clinical features and cognitive functioning in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia among Han Chinese inpatients.
   Method: We compared gender differences in 262 unmedicated first-episode schizophrenia and 960 chronic schizophrenia inpatients (diagnosed according to DSM-IV) to 804 matched healthy controls on sociodemographic characteristics, smoking behavior, and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Patients were also rated on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The study was conducted from December 2006 to May 2008.
   Results: Schizophrenia first occurred in both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients at a significantly earlier age in male than female patients (P < .05 and P < .001, respectively). The paranoid subtype of schizophrenia was more common in female patients only in chronic schizophrenia, not first-episode patients. Further, cigarette smoking was more common in male than female patients from both patient groups, and, among men, more chronic schizophrenia patients than controls smoked, while among women, fewer chronic schizophrenia patients than controls smoked. Female chronic schizophrenia patients had more severe positive and general psychopathological symptoms, whereas male patients had more severe negative symptoms. By contrast, first-episode schizophrenia patients showed no gender differences in symptoms and severity. Both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients performed worse than controls on most of the cognitive tasks. RBANS attention, delayed memory, and immediate memory were less impaired in female than male chronic schizophrenia patients, and first-episode schizophrenia patients showed no gender differences.
   Conclusions: Chronic schizophrenia patients have notable gender differences in the age at onset, smoking, symptom severity, and cognitive function favoring women, but first-episode schizophrenia patients show few gender differences.

AB Older individuals who recognize their cognitive difficulties are more likely to adjust their everyday life to their actual cognitive functioning, particularly when they are able to estimate their abilities accurately. We assessed self- and spouse-ratings of memory and attention difficulties in everyday life of healthy, older individuals and compared them with the respective test performance. Eighty-four older individuals (women's age, M = 67.4 years, SD = 5.2; men's age, M = 68.5 years, SD = 4.9) completed both the self and the spouse versions of the Attention Deficit Questionnaire and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire and completed two neuropsychological tests. Using the residual score approach, subjective metacognitive measures of memory and attention were created and compared with actual test performance. Significant associations between subjective and objective scores were found only for men and only for episodic memory measures. Men who underreported memory difficulties performed more poorly; men who overreported memory difficulties performed better. Men's recognition performance was best predicted by subjective measures (R-2 = .25), followed by delayed recall (R-2 = .14) and forgetting rate (R-2 = .13). The results indicate gender-specific differences in metacognitive accuracy and predictive validity of subjective ratings.

AB The authors test the hypothesis that low-effort thought promotes political conservatism. In Study 1, alcohol intoxication was measured among bar patrons; as blood alcohol level increased, so did political conservatism (controlling for sex, education, and political identification). In Study 2, participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes than their no-load counterparts. In Study 3, time pressure increased participants' endorsement of conservative terms. In Study 4, participants considering political terms in a cursory manner endorsed conservative terms more than those asked to cogitate; an indicator of effortful thought (recognition memory) partially mediated the relationship between processing effort and conservatism. Together these data suggest that political conservatism may be a process consequence of low-effort thought; when effortful, deliberate thought is disengaged, endorsement of conservative ideology increases.

AB Many research questions require a within-class object recognition task matched for general cognitive requirements with a face recognition task. If the object task also has high internal reliability, it can improve accuracy and power in group analyses (e.g., mean inversion effects for faces vs. objects), individual-difference studies (e.g., correlations between certain perceptual abilities and face/object recognition), and case studies in neuropsychology (e.g., whether a prosopagnosic shows a face-specific or object-general deficit). Here, we present such a task. Our Cambridge Car Memory Test (CCMT) was matched in format to the established Cambridge Face Memory Test, requiring recognition of exemplars across view and lighting change. We tested 153 young adults (93 female). Results showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .84) and a range of scores suitable both for normal-range individual-difference studies and, potentially, for diagnosis of impairment. The mean for males was much higher than the mean for females. We demonstrate independence between face memory and car memory (dissociation based on sex, plus a modest correlation between the two), including where participants have high relative expertise with cars. We also show that expertise with real car makes and models of the era used in the test significantly predicts CCMT performance. Surprisingly, however, regression analyses imply that there is an effect of sex per se on the CCMT that is attributable to a stereotypical male advantage in car expertise.

AB Background: There are discrepant findings regarding which subscales of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) are able to predict cognitive decline. The study aimed to identify the baseline CAMCOG subscales that can discriminate between patients and predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: This was a five-year case-control study of patients with cognitive impairment and a control group. Participants were grouped into AD (n = 121), MCI converted to dementia (MCI-Ad, n = 43), MCI-stable (MCI-St, n = 66), and controls (CTR, n = 112). Differences in the mean scores obtained by the four groups were examined. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare subscale scores in the AD and MCI-Ad groups with those of controls. The influence of age, gender, schooling, and depression on baseline subscale scores was assessed.
   Results: Of the CAMCOG subscales, Orientation and Memory (learning and recent) (OR + MEM) showed the highest discriminant capacity in the baseline analysis of the four groups. This baseline analysis indicated that OR + MEM was the best predictor of conversion to AD in the MCI-Ad group (area under the curve, AUC = 0.81), whereas the predictive capacity of the global MMSE and CAMCOG scores was poor (AUC = 0.59 and 0.53, respectively).
   Conclusions: In the baseline analysis, the Orientation and Memory (learning and recent) subscales showed the highest discriminant and predictive capacity as regards both cognitive decline in the AD group and conversion to AD among MCI-Ad patients. This was not affected by age, gender, schooling, or depression.

AB Although studies have shown females' superiority in episodic memory, it is unclear whether such superiority is modulated by emotionality of stimuli. Furthermore, episodic memory consists of two elements item memory and source memory. It is unclear whether females have advantages in both elements. This study examined gender differences in item memory and source memory for neutral and emotional words. The major findings are that females were superior to males in item memory for neutral and emotional words but did not differ from males in source memory. Additionally, it is enhancement of recollection rather than familiarity, that contributed to females' superiority in recognition. The above findings highlight the need to differentiate elements of episodic memory in examining gender differences. Possible mechanisms underlying the above findings (e.g., gender differences in verbal strategies) were discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: Limited data are available regarding the prevalence and nature of invalid computerized baseline neurocognitive test data.
   Objective: To identify the prevalence of invalid baselines on the desktop and online versions of ImPACT and to document the utility of correcting for left-right (L-R) confusion on the desktop version of ImPACT.
   Design: Cross-sectional study of independent samples of high school (HS) and collegiate athletes who completed the desktop or online versions of ImPACT.
   Participants or Other Participants: A total of 3769 HS (desktop = 1617, online = 2152) and 2130 collegiate (desktop = 742, online = 1388) athletes completed preseason baseline assessments.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Prevalence of 5 ImPACT validity indicators, with correction for L-R confusion (reversing left and right mouse-click responses) on the desktop version, by test version and group. Chi-square analyses were conducted for sex and attentional or learning disorders.
   Results: At least 1 invalid indicator was present on 11.9% (desktop) versus 6.3% (online) of the HS baselines and 10.2% (desktop) versus 4.1% (online) of collegiate baselines; correcting for L-R confusion (desktop) decreased this overall prevalence to 8.4% (HS) and 7.5% (collegiate). Online Impulse Control scores alone yielded 0.4% (HS) and 0.9% (collegiate) invalid baselines, compared with 9.0% (HS) and 5.4% (collegiate) on the desktop version; correcting for L-R confusion (desktop) decreased the prevalence of invalid Impulse Control scores to 5.4% (HS) and 2.6% (collegiate). Male athletes and HS athletes with attention deficit or learning disorders who took the online version were more likely to have at least 1 invalid indicator. Utility of additional invalidity indicators is reported.
   Conclusions: The online ImPACT version appeared to yield fewer invalid baseline results than did the desktop version. Identification of L-R confusion reduces the prevalence of invalid baselines (desktop only) and the potency of Impulse Control as a validity indicator. We advise test administrators to be vigilant in identifying invalid baseline results as part of routine concussion management and prevention programs.

(C) 2012 The Authors. Journal compilation (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objectives: Cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD) is well established in the literature; however, there are few studies of neurocognition in patients early in the course of the illness. In this study we compare neurocognitive function in a cohort of first-contact mania patients with a healthy control group matched for age, gender, and education. Methods: Patients with a first manic episode (FM) (n = 34) or previous untreated manic episodes (PM) (n = 21) were neuropsychologically tested following their first treated manic episode. A total of 110 matched healthy control comparison subjects were also tested. The following cognitive domains were evaluated: verbal and visual learning and memory, attention, processing speed, executive functioning, and IQ. Results were corrected for speed of processing differences and were compared with previously reported results for multiple-episode BD patients. Results: BD patients early in their disease course showed impairments in psychomotor speed, attention, learning and memory, executive functioning, and IQ. When controlling for speed of processing, measures of visuoconstructive reasoning and motor dexterity remained statistically significant. Eighteen percent of FM and 16% of PM patients were found to have clinically significant neurocognitive impairment. No significant relationship between clinical symptoms and neurocognition was found. The first-contact mania patients studied were found to have smaller neurocognitive deficits compared to multiple-episode patients in previous studies. Conclusions: Neurocognitive dysfunction is present in early BD and is clinically significant for a proportion of patients. Our findings also suggest that neurocognitive dysfunction may increase with illness progression.

AB This study examined the relationship between cognitive function and sleep onset/maintenance difficulties (SO/MD) in nondemented older adults. We hypothesized that SO/MD negatively impacts cognition and that older adults with lower education would be especially vulnerable to its effects. The sample comprised 549 older adults from the Einstein Aging Study (EAS), a community-based cohort. Participants completed neuropsychological assessment and a sleep questionnaire. Univariate ANCOVAs were performed with cognitive performance as a dependent variable, SO/MD (present or absent) and education (lower: <= 12 years; higher: > 12 years) as between-subjects factors, and age, ethnicity, gender, depression, and cardiovascular comorbidies as covariates. Participants were an average age of 79.7 +/- 5.0 years (range = 71-97 years). Fifty-seven percent (n = 314) of the sample met criteria for SO/MD. Among participants with SO/MD, those with lower education performed more poorly on a test of category fluency than participants with higher education (means: 35.2 vs. 41.0; p < .001); among older adults without SO/MD, educational attainment had no measurable effect on cognition (SO/MD X education interaction (F(1,536) = 14.5; p =.00)). Consistent with the cognitive reserve hypothesis, older adults with lower education appear selectively vulnerable to the negative effects of sleep onset/maintenance difficulties on tests of verbal fluency.

AB In this study we assessed the potential moderating roles of stimulus type (emotionally arousing) and participants' characteristics (gender) in older adults' associative memory deficit. In two experiments, young and older participants studied lists that included neutral and emotionally arousing word pairs (positive and negative) and completed recognition tests for the words and their associations. In Experiment 1, the majority of the word pairs were composed of two nouns, whereas in Experiment 2 they were composed of adjective-noun pairs. The results extend evidence for older adults' associative deficit and suggest that older and younger adults' item memory is improved for emotionally arousing words. However, associative memory for the word pairs did not benefit (and even showed a slight decline) from emotionally arousing words, which was the case for both younger and older adults. In addition, in these experiments, gender appeared to moderate the associative deficit of older adults, with older males but not females demonstrating this deficit.

AB Background and purpose: Subjective language complaints (SLC) are common during ageing but have not been investigated in detail. We aim to determine their association with demographic and clinical variables and objective cognitive performance.
   Methods: A sample of 479 individuals aged 50 years or above (average 66 +/- 9.1 years), followed in primary care, with no history of brain disorder were asked two questions concerning SLC, fulfilled a depression scale and undertook a battery of cognitive tests. Response to questions regarding proper name retrieval (PNR) and word finding difficulties (WFD) was studied and their contribution to each measure of the battery calculated by repeated linear regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, education, living alone and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Word finding difficulties (47.6%) were more frequently reported than problematic PNR (10.9%). Both were more common in women, in subjects with depressive symptoms and in those living alone, but were unrelated with age or education. Both symptoms contributed significantly to the variance in tests of semantic fluency and episodic memory. PNR was also associated with immediate phonological memory.
   Conclusions: Subjective language complaints are especially common amongst individuals living alone and/or with depressive symptoms. They are associated with a worse cognitive performance in some memory and language-executive tests. Further studies are needed to understand their predictive value for cognitive decline.

AB Studies in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) have associated regional brain abnormalities with memory impairment. While memory problems in children with MS are often reported, little is known about the neural correlates that may contribute to these difficulties. We measured verbal and nonverbal memory using the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL-2) in 32 children and adolescents with MS and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Memory performance was correlated with volumetric measures of the whole brain, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Brain volumes were normalized for age and sex using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Institutes of Health MRI Study of Normal Brain development. With the exception of story recall, performance on memory tests was similar to that of the control group. Relative to controls, patient with MS showed reduced volume in the whole brain (p < .001), amygdala (p < .005), and thalamus (p < .001), but not the hippocampus. In the patient group, word-list learning correlated with whole brain volume (r = .53) and hippocampal volume (r = .43), whereas visual recognition memory correlated with thalamic volume (r = .48). Findings are consistent with the well-established role of the hippocampus in learning and consolidation and also highlight the importance of diffuse brain pathology on memory function.

AB Objective: Fototest is a short simple test, applicable to illiterate subjects and not influenced by educational level. The purpose of this study is to assess its validity for cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia (DEM) under routine clinical practice conditions.
   Material and methods: A cross-sectional, multicentre and naturalistic study conducted in General Neurology clinics. The subjects were, over 60 years old, with a previously established diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NoCI), cognitive impairment without dementia (CInoDEM), or dementia (DEM). The discriminant validity was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and probability coefficients. Partial corelations were calculated, adjusted for age, sex and education level with Eurotest, verbal fluency test (VFT) and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score to evaluate the concurrent and construct validity.
   Results: Nineteen neurologists included a total of 589 subjects: 361 NoCI, 10 CINoDEM and 122 DEM. The discriminant value was better for DEM (AUC 0.94 +/- 0.02) than for CI (0.86 +/- 0.02). For DEM the best cut-off point was 26/27 (Sn = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97], Sp = 0.87 [95% CI, 0.84-0.90)); and for CI, 28/29 (Sn=0.71 [95% CI, 0.65-0.77], Sp = 0.84 [95% Cl, 0.80-088]). Fototest showed a high and significant correlation with Eurotest (r = 0.70 +/- 0.02), VFT (r=0.68 +/- 0.02) and the GDS score (r=-0.77 +/- 0.02).
   Conclusion: The Fototest showed adequate validity for CI and DEM in general Neurology clinics in an extensive and wide geographical area. (C) 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB Determinants of cognitive performance in old age have received limited attention in Latin America. We investigated the association of socio-demographic and health-related variables with cognitive performance in a sample of older adults with limited educational experience living in a poor subdistrict of the city of Sao Paulo. This was a cross-sectional population-based study which included a sample of 384 seniors 65 years and older. Cognition was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB) (episodic memory test with 10 pictures, verbal fluency (VF), Clock Drawing Test (CDT)). Results indicated that age, sex, schooling, depressive symptoms, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) level had a significant impact on the cognitive performance of the sample. Therefore, pharmacological and psychosocial interventions with a focus on improving mood and controlling hypertension may have beneficial effects on cognition among seniors with similar socio-demographic characteristics.

AB It is unclear whether the longitudinal relation between activity participation and cognitive ability is due to preserved differentiation (active individuals have higher initial levels of cognitive ability), or differential preservation (active individuals show less negative change across time). This distinction has never been evaluated after dividing time-varying activity into its two sources of variation: between-person and within-person variability. Further, few studies have investigated how the association between activity participation and cognitive ability may differ from early to older adulthood. Using the PATH Through Life Project, we evaluated whether between- and within-person variation in activity participation was associated with cognitive ability and change within cohorts aged 20-24 years, 40-44 years, and 60-64 years at baseline (n = 7,152) assessed on three occasions over an 8-year interval. Multilevel models indicated that between-person differences in activity significantly predicted baseline cognitive ability for all age cohorts and for each assessed cognitive domain (perceptual speed, short-term memory, working memory, episodic memory, and vocabulary), even after accounting for sex, education, occupational status, and physical and mental health. In each case, greater average participation was associated with higher baseline cognitive ability. However, the size of the relationship involving average activity participation and baseline cognitive ability did not differ across adulthood. Between-person activity and within-person variation in activity level were both not significantly associated with change in cognitive test performance. Results suggest that activity participation is indeed related to cognitive ability across adulthood, but only in relation to the starting value of cognitive ability, and not change over time.

AB Metabolic and cognitive disorders are closely related. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this association is still elusive. Given the importance of energy metabolism in neuronal cells, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master switch of energy metabolism, could be an independent factor affecting cognitive as well as metabolic functions. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the AMPK gamma 2 gene, the PRKAG2 -26C/T polymorphism and cognitive impairment or diabetes in 1609 subjects aged from 60 to 80. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age, gender, education, smoking, alcohol, depression, waist circumference, APOE e4, and stroke history. We found a significant association between the -26C/T polymorphism (CC vs. CT/TT) and cognitive impairment (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3). Moreover, this polymorphism (CC/CT vs. TT) was also related to the presence of diabetes (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8). Importantly, the relationship with cognitive impairment was still significant in non-diabetic individuals (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4). Further analyses with a subpopulation (n = 611) revealed that CC homozygotes relative to T-allele carriers had significantly better performances in verbal memory and attentional tasks. These findings collectively support a hypothesis that AMPK has a role not only in metabolic functioning but also in cognitive functioning in humans. Extended longitudinal study with a larger number of samples is warranted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined sex differences in the emotional memory consolidation, and the impact of stress-induced cortisol and salivary alpha amylase responses on emotional memory recall. Following baseline salivary measures, 39 healthy women and 41 men viewed 20 neutral and 20 negative arousing images, and then underwent either a cold pressor stress test or control condition, followed by further salivary measures. Participants returned two days later for a free recall test. The stress condition induced greater cortisol response, and negative images were better recalled than neutral. Whereas women displayed greater recall of negative images under stress than men, they recalled fewer negative images in the control condition. Stress-induced cortisol predicted recall of negative images in women, and neutral images in men. This suggests there is an enhanced consolidation of negative images under stress in women that may be a potential mechanism for the greater female prevalence for developing anxiety disorders.

AB Objective: Examine age group effects and sex differences by applying a comprehensive computerized battery of identical behavioral measures linked to brain systems in youths that were already genotyped. Such information is needed to incorporate behavioral data as neuropsychological "biomarkers" in large-scale genomic studies. Method: We developed and applied a brief computerized neurocognitive battery that provides measures of performance accuracy and response time for executive-control, episodic memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and sensorimotor speed domains. We tested a population-based sample of 3,500 genotyped youths ages 8-21 years. Results: Substantial improvement with age occurred for both accuracy and speed, but the rates varied by domain. The most pronounced improvement was noted in executive control functions, specifically attention, and in motor speed, with some effect sizes exceeding 1.8 standard deviation units. The least pronounced age group effect was in memory, where only face memory showed a large effect size on improved accuracy. Sex differences had much smaller effect sizes but were evident, with females outperforming males on attention, word and face memory, reasoning speed, and all social cognition tests and males outperforming females in spatial processing and sensorimotor and motor speed. These sex differences in most domains were seen already at the youngest age groups, and age group X sex interactions indicated divergence at the oldest groups with females becoming faster but less accurate tan males. Conclusions: The results indicate that cognitive performance improves substantially in this age span, with large effect sizes that differ by domain. The more pronounced improvement for executive and reasoning domains than for memory suggests that memory capacities have reached their apex before age 8. Performance was sexually modulated and most sex differences were apparent by early adolescence.

AB Low perceived control is considered a risk factor for poor cognitive functioning, but the mechanisms are unclear. The goal of the present study was to analyze anxiety and task interference as sequential mediators of the association between control beliefs and episodic memory. Cognitive-specific control beliefs were assessed prior to the lab session. State anxiety was assessed in the lab, followed by a word list recall task. The frequency of intrusive thoughts during the memory task was reported by the participants as a measure of task interference after the completion of the cognitive testing. The results for 152 participants from the ages of 22 to 84 years supported the predicted three-path mediation model. Lower levels of control beliefs were associated with higher state anxiety, which in turn affected episodic memory performance by increasing the likelihood of task interference, with age, sex, and verbal abilities as covariates. The implications of the results for developing interventions to improve memory performance are considered.

AB Context: Cushing's syndrome (CS) affects cognition and memory.
   Objective: Our objective was to evaluate memory and hippocampal volumes (HV) on 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) in CS patients and controls.
   Patients and Methods: Thirty-three CS patients (11 active, 22 cured) and 34 controls matched for age, sex, and education underwent Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure memory tests. Gray matter and HV were calculated on 3T MRI, using FreeSurfer image analyses software.
   Results: No differences in HV were observed between active and cured CS or controls. Memory performance was worse in CS patients than controls (P < 0.04 in active; P < 0.03 in cured CS) but did not differ among CS groups, which were therefore analyzed together; they performed worse for verbal (P = 0.02) and visual memory (P = 0.04) than controls. In 12 CS patients, memory was below normative cutoff values for verbal (n = 6, cured), visual memory (n = 10, six cured) or both (n = 4); these patients with severe memory impairments showed smaller HV compared with their matched controls (P = 0.02 with verbal impairment; P = 0.03 with visual impairment). They were older (P = 0.04), had shorter education (P = 0.02), and showed a trend toward longer duration of hypercortisolism (P = 0.07) than the remaining CS patients. Total (P = 0.004) and cortical (P = 0.03) brain gray matter volumes were decreased in CS compared with controls, indicating brain atrophy, whereas subcortical gray matter (which includes HV) was reduced only in the 12 patients with severe memory impairment.
   Conclusion: Verbal and visual memory is worse in CS patients than controls, even after biochemical cure. HV was decreased only in those whose memory scores were below normative cutoff values. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: 663-671, 2012)

AB Introduction: Neuropsychological assessment of patients with dementia necessitates the use of varied memory tasks designed to measure different memory processes, including information memorization, retention and retrieval. A valid memory battery should be demonstrated to discriminate between demented and non-demented subjects and its scores should be related to the degree of intellectual impairment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of Choynowski's Memory Scale in assessment of patients with dementia.
   Material and methods: Thirty-two patients with dementia and 64 age- and gender- matched healthy controls took part in the study. All participants were examined by means of Choynowski's Memory Scale, and the patients were additionally assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test (CDT).
   Results: All subtests of Choynowski's Memory Scale were found to highly significantly (p <= 0.001) discriminate between patients with dementia and healthy controls. Except for Digit Span, all other subtests of Choynowski's battery were highly correlated with the global mental status as assessed by MMSE with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.59 to 0.81. Most subtests of Choynowski's Memory Scale were also moderately or highly correlated with performance on the CDT, and the correlations coefficients between the total score on Memory Scale and the CDT were r = 0.66 and r = 0.61 (p <= 0.001) for the free recall drawing and copying, respectively.
   Conclusions: Choynowski's Memory Scale showed high discriminative properties and strong associations with the degree of intellectual impairment in dementia. The results encourage the use of this battery in clinical settings.

AB Objectives: To investigate the effect of cognitive support (an associative orienting instruction at encoding) on contextual memory in depressed patients.
   Methods: Seventeen patients (age 20-40 years, 14 women) diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 22 healthy controls matched for age, gender and education completed a recognition memory task for item (object) and context (location), with or without an incidental binding cue at encoding. In addition, participants completed the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS III) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Salivary samples were collected at 7 AM, 4 PM and 10 PM on the day of testing for cortisol and DHEA level measurement.
   Results: Depressed patients showed a deficit in contextual memory in the absence of a binding cue but did not differ from healthy controls in item memory or when a binding cue was present. Cortisol and cortisol/DHEA ratios were lower in depressed patients compared to healthy controls and correlated with memory deficits.
   Conclusions: Contextual memory deficits in MDD patients can be reduced by providing cognitive support at encoding. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the assumption that boys are more likely to tackle reading based on the visual modality, we assessed reading skills, visual short-term memory (VSTM), visual long-term memory for details (VLTM-D), and general non-verbal cognitive ability in primary school children. Reading was within the normal range in both accuracy and understanding. There was no reading performance gap in favour of girls, on the contrary, in this sample boys read better. An entire array of visual, non-verbal processes was associated directly or indirectly with reading in boys, whereas this pattern was not observed for the girls.

AB Objective: To study postnatal. dexamethasone treatment effects on cognitive, neuropsychological and behavioral functioning at early School age in preterm children.
   Study Design: We recruited 222 children born between 1998 and 2003: 114 extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g;60 dexamethasone-treated; 54 untreated) and 108 term-born. Data were analyzed using multivariate methods.
   Result: Preterm performed below term-born on all measures. Dexamethasone-treated performed below dexamethasone-untreated in immediate visual memory, visual-motor integration, mathematical skill and motor dexterity. However, stepwise regression indicated that Medical and sociodemographic factors other than dexamethasone contributed to preterm group differences.
   Conclusion: Dexamethasone alone does not explain neurocognitive impairment in preterm children. Medical and sociodemographic factors (illness severity, male gender and parental education) are influential. Prospective longitudinal neuropsychological and behavioral Study from preschool to school age that considers medical and sociodemographic. variables will best address effects of dexamethasone exposure.

AB Retention of information over extended time periods places special demands on the brain. The neural correlates of memory performance after a short delay of 30 min and a long delay of 1 week are likely partly different, but we do not know how structural maturation of the brain contributes to the differential development of these functions. This question was investigated in a sample of 107 children and adolescents aged 8-19 years. Measures used were structural magnetic resonance imaging and the Rey Complex Figure Test copy, organizational strategy, and 30-min and 1-week recall. While the amount of details copied and later recalled after both 30 min and 1 week increased with age, the relative saving over 1 week (1-week/30-min ratio score) did not increase with age. Thirty minutes recall performance was related to thinner left orbitofrontal cortex independently of age and organizational strategy measured during copy, possibly reflecting executive components of retrieval or encoding processes. In contrast, the 1-week/30-min ratio, likely reflecting consolidation of memory traces, was related to larger bilateral hippocampal volume. This indicates that differential developmental effects on memory for short and long periods of time are related to differentially developing brain structures.

AB Memory complaints of patients sometimes are not verified via standard cognitive testing. Acquisition of information in everyday life requires memorization in complex three-dimensional environments. The authors mimicked this with a photorealistic virtual environment (VE). Memory for verbal material and spatial scenery was tested in healthy controls (HC) and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD); mini-mental state evaluation (MMSE) 25.7 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- standard deviation). The number of memorized items increased to 90% in both classical list learning and for items memorized in VE in HC. In contrast, only 40% of items were recalled in list learning and 20% in VE in AD patients. Unlike the gender difference favoring female HC on list learning, performance was alike for both genders in VE. We conclude that verbal learning abilities in healthy elderly subjects are alike in standard settings and under virtual reality conditions. In AD patients memory deficits that are relevant to everyday life yet not detectable with list learning are unmasked in virtual reality. In future, this may aid objective appraisal of interventions with regard to their everyday relevance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The irreversible airflow limitation characterised by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes a decrease in the oxygen supply to the brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate brain structural damage in COPD.
   Design: Retrospective case control study. Patients with COPD and healthy volunteers were recruited. The two groups were matched in age, gender and educational background.
   Setting: A hospital and a number of communities: they are all located in southern Fujian province, China.
   Participants: 25 stable patients and 25 controls were enrolled from December 2009 to May 2011.
   Methods: Using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics based on MRI to analyse grey matter (GM) density and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), respectively, and a battery of neuropsychological tests were performed.
   Results: Patients with COPD (vs controls) showed decreased GM density in the limbic and paralimbic structures, including right gyrus rectus, left precentral gyrus, bilateral anterior and middle cingulate gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri, bilateral anterior insula extending to Rolandic operculum, bilateral thalamus/pulvinars and left caudate nucleus. Patients with COPD (vs controls) had decreased FA values in the bilateral superior corona radiata, bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral optic radiation, bilateral lingual gyri, left parahippocampal gyrus and fornix. Lower FA values in these regions were associated with increased radial diffusivity and no changes of longitudinal diffusivity. Patients with COPD had poor performances in the Mini-Mental State Examination, figure memory and visual reproduction. GM density in some decreased regions in COPD had positive correlations with arterial blood Po-2, negative correlations with disease duration and also positive correlations with visual tasks.
   Conclusion: The authors demonstrated that COPD exhibited loss of regional GM accompanied by impairment of white matter microstructural integrity, which was associated with disease severity and may underlie the pathophysiological and psychological changes of COPD.

AB Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given that patients with early-onset AD (EOAD) and with late-onset AD (LOAD) are known to have different clinical courses, symptoms and neuroimaging findings, early-onset (EOMCI) and late-onset aMCI (LOMCI) might be expected to have similar differences as EOAD versus LOAD. Methods: Our study involving 425 patients with aMCI (124 EOMCI, 301 LOMCI), who were followed for around 1.5 years, and 958 normal control subjects (NC) investigated neuropsychological characteristics and prediction of progression to AD in patients with EOMCI versus LOMCI. Neuropsychological scores were compared between EOMCI, LOMCI and NC with analyses of covariance controlling age, gender, education and disease duration. The risk of AD conversion was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard analyses. Results: The baseline neuropsychological performances were comparable between EOMCI and LOMCI. Visuospatial memory for EOMCI and verbal memory scores for LOMCI were significant predictors of AD conversion. Conclusion: Our study indicates that EOMCI with visuospatial memory impairment, which implies underlying right predominant pathology, and LOMCI with poor verbal memory, which suggests underlying left predominant pathology, are individual conditions at an increased risk of conversion to AD.

AB Do women have a recall advantage for what others say? And does it matter what type of information another person shares with them? Women's greater interdependence in self-construal was predicted to give them an advantage over men in their memory for information shared about close others. In an experimental study, 124 undergraduate students (64 women and 60 men) from a Midwestern university in the United States watched either a videotaped male or female target discussing his or her lifestyle habits, health goals, and family. Participants then completed a surprise recognition test of their memory for what the target had said. Results show men were as accurate as women at remembering personal information shared by the targets, but women more accurately recalled what was said about the targets' family members. The implications of these findings for various professional relationships are discussed.

AB Normative information is important for appropriate interpretation of cognitive test scores as a critical component of dementia diagnosis in the elderly population. A cross-sectional evaluation of 1826 participants aged 65 years and older from four rural counties in China was conducted using six cognitive instruments including tests of global cognitive function (the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia), memory (Word List Learning and Recall tasks from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, IU Story), language (Animal Fluency Test), and executive function (IU Token). Multiple regression models adjusting for demographic variables were used to provide standardized residuals z-scores and corresponding percentile ranking for each cognitive test. In all cognitive tests older age was associated with worse test performance while exposure to education was related to better cognitive test performance. We also detected a significant gender difference with men scoring better than women and a significant gender by education interaction on two tests. The interaction indicates that gender difference in test scores was much smaller in participants with more education than those who had less or no education. These demographically adjusted, regression-based norms can be a useful tool to clinicians involved with differential diagnosis of cognitive and memory disorders in older adults in rural China.

Performance was compared with age, sex, and education of a matched control group (N = 135). We found that HI-CP is accompanied with low level of correct answers and high levels of task-relevant and task-irrelevant intrusions and repetitions on the Memory with Pause and Homogeneous Interference short-term memory tasks. Person-oriented analyses revealed several different configurations of dysfunction in the HI-CP group.

AB Spatial location memory has rarely been assessed in young children due to a scarcity of developmentally appropriate tests. This study sought to compare nonverbal learning and recall in children born extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1000 g) and less than 33 gestational weeks (GW) with term-born children at early school age using a recently developed and adapted test. We administered a modification of the Hopkins Board to 210 children at age six; 84 born ELBW (35 born < 26 GW; 49 born 26-33 GW) and 126 term-born. Six measures were obtained: naming, trials-to-criterion, errors-to-criterion, delayed item recall, delayed location recall, and percent retention. After age correction, ELBW children had worse general cognition, item naming, delayed item recall, delayed location recall, and percent retention than term-born children. Delayed item recall and percent retention performances of ELBW children remained worse after correction for general cognition. ELBW groups (< 26 GW and 26-33 GW) groups performed worse than term-born children in naming and delayed item recall with chronological age as covariate. Those born before 26 GW, but not 26-33 GW, performed worse than term-born children in delayed location recall and percent retention. Differences remained significant after controlling for gender, maternal education, and delivery type. All three groups' performance declined from final learning trial to delayed location recall, with a decline greater for less than 26 GW than term-born children. Extreme prematurity (< 26 GW) and ELBW are significant risk factors for spatial location memory deficit. The modified Hopkins Board discriminated high-risk preterm and term-born children at early school age and appears to be a useful test to measure this rarely studied cognitive capacity.

AB Previous research suggests that the own-race bias (ORB) in memory for faces is a result of other-race faces receiving less visual attention at encoding. As women typically display an own-gender bias in memory for faces and men do not, we investigated whether face gender and sex of viewer influenced visual attention and memory for own-and other-race faces, and if preferential viewing of own-race faces contributed to the ORB in memory. Participants viewed pairs of female or male own-and other-race faces while their viewing time was recorded. Afterwards, they completed a surprise memory test. We found that (1) other-race males received the initial focus of attention, (2) own-race faces were viewed longer than other-race faces over time, although the difference was larger for female faces, and (3) even though longer viewing time increased the probability of remembering a face, it did not explain the magnified ORB in memory for female faces. Importantly, these findings highlight that face gender moderates attentional responses to and memory for own-and other-race faces.

AB Gender differences in susceptibility to associative memory illusions in the Deese/Roediger-McDermott paradigm were investigated using negative and neutral word lists. Women (n = 50) and men (n = 50) studied 20 lists of 12 words that were associates of a non-presented critical lure. Ten lists were associates of negatively valenced lures (e. g., cry, evil) and ten were associates of neutral lures (e. g., chair, slow). When asked to recall the words after each list, women falsely recalled more negative lures than men, but there was no gender difference in the false recall of neutral lures. These findings suggest that women reflect on associations within negative lists to a greater degree than men and are thereby more likely to generate the negative critical lures.

AB Recent meta-analyses point towards a pathogenic role of the Val66Met variant of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in major depressive disorder, specifically in males. We investigated whether BDNFVal66Met shows a male-specific interaction with childhood stressful life events on affective memory bias, a cognitive susceptibility factor for depression. Healthy volunteers (n=430; 272 females and 158 males) were genotyped for BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) and completed the self-referent encoding task and a childhood stressful life events scale. BDNF Met carriers reporting childhood events tended to recall a lower proportion of positive words compared to Val/Val homozygotes reporting childhood events. Sex-specific analyses revealed that the BDNF genotype x childhood events interaction was significant in male participants and not in female participants. The results suggest that in males, BDNF Val66Met interacts with childhood life events, increasing the cognitive susceptibility markers of depression. In females, this effect may be independent of BDNF Val66Met. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Neuropsychological (CERAD-NP) battery represents a commonly used neuropsychological instrument to measure cognitive functioning in the elderly. This study provides normative data for changes in cognitive function that normally occur in cognitively healthy individuals to interpret changes in CERAD-NP test scores over longer time periods. Design: Longitudinal cohort study with three assessments at 1.5-year intervals over a period of 3 years. Setting: Primary care medical record registry sample. Participants: As part of the German Study on Ageing, Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care Patients, a sample of 1,450 cognitively healthy general practitioner patients, age 75 years and older, was assessed. Measurements: Age-, education-, and gender-specific Reliable Change Indices (RCIs) were computed for a 90% confidence interval for selected subtests of the CERAD-NP battery. Results: Across different age, education, and gender subgroups, changes from at least six to nine points in Verbal Fluency, four to eight points in Word List Memory, two to four points in Word List Recall, and one to four points in Word List Recognition indicated significant (i.e. reliable) changes in CERAD-NP test scores at the 90% confidence level. Furthermore, the calculation of RCIs for individual patients is demonstrated. Conclusions: Smaller changes in CERAD-NP test scores can be interpreted with only high uncertainty because of probable measurement error, practice effects, and normal age-related cognitive decline. This study, for the first time, provides age-, education-, and gender-specific CERAD-NP reference values on the basis of RCI methods for the interpretation of cognitive changes in older-age groups.

AB Sex differences in patterns of cognitive test performance have been attributed to factors, such as sex hormones or sexual dimorphisms in brain structure, that change with normal aging. The current study examined sex differences in patterns of cognitive test performance in healthy elderly individuals. Cognitive test scores of 957 men and women (age 67-89), matched for overall level of cognitive test performance, age, education, and depression scale score, were compared. Men and women were indistinguishable on tests of auditory divided attention, category fluency, and executive functioning. In contrast, women performed better than men on tests of psychomotor speed and verbal learning and memory, whereas men outperformed women on tests of visuoconstruction and visual perception. Our finding that the pattern of sex differences in cognition observed in young adults is observed in old age has implications for future studies of both healthy elderly individuals and of those with cognitive disorders.

AB Cognitively challenging activities may support the mental abilities of older adults. The use of computers and the Internet provides divergent cognitive challenges to older persons, and in previous studies, positive effects of computer and Internet use on the quality of life have been demonstrated. The present study addresses two research aims regarding predictors of computer use and the relationship between computer use and changes in cognitive abilities over a 6-year period in both younger (24-49 years) and older adults (older than 50 years). Data were obtained from an ongoing study into cognitive aging: the Maastricht Aging Study, involving 1823 normal aging adults who were followed for 9 years. The results showed age-related differences in predictors of computer use: the only predictor in younger participants was level of education, while in older participants computer use was also predicted by age, sex and feelings of loneliness. Protective effects of computer use were found for measures of selective attention and memory, in both older and younger participants. Effect sizes were small, which suggests that promotion of computer activities in older adults to prevent cognitive decline may not be an efficient strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of episodic memory impairment is required for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia by all current diagnostic criteria. The new research criteria proposed by Dubois et al. (Lancet Neurol 6:734-746, 2007) require that the impairment should not improve significantly with cueing, recognition testing nor after the control of effective encoding. This is considered to be the core deficit of "prodromal Alzheimer's disease". The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is a memory test that allows in assessing these specific features of memory impairment. Here, we report normative data for an Italian version of the FCSRT. The test is based on the 12 pictorial stimuli, 6 belonging to the living domain, and 6 to the non-living domain. Six scores were derived from the performance of 227 healthy Italian adults, with age, sex and education homogenously distributed across subgroups: immediate free recall (IFR), immediate total recall (ITR), delayed-free recall (DFR), delayed total recall (DTR), Index of Sensitivity of Cueing (ISC), number of intrusions. In multiple regression analyses, age emerged as an influencing factor for both IFR and DFR, with older people obtaining lower scores. Education and gender appear to influence only IFR, with better performance by more educated subjects and females. Adjusted scores were used to determine inferential cutoff scores and to compute equivalent scores.

AB One of the major problems that clinical neuropsychology has had in memory clinics is to apply ecological, easily administrable and sensitive tests that can make the diagnosis of dementia both precocious and reliable. Often the choice of the best neuropsychological test is hard because of a number of variables that can influence a subject's performance. In this regard, tests originally devised to investigate cognitive functions in healthy adults are not often appropriate to analyze cognitive performance in old subjects with low education because of their intrinsically complex nature. In the present paper, we present normative values for the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure B Test (ROCF-B) a simple test that explores constructional praxis and visuospatial memory. We collected normative data of copy, immediate and delayed recall of the ROCF-B in a group of 346 normal Italian subjects above 40 years. A multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential effect of age, sex, and education on the three tasks administered to the subjects. Age and education had a significant effect on copying, immediate recall, and delayed recall as well as on the rate of forgetting. Correction grids and equivalent scores with cut-off values relative to each task are available. The availability of normative values can make the ROCF-B a valid instrument to assess non-verbal memory in adults and in the elderly for whom the commonly used ROCF-A is too demanding.

Results from multiple regression analyses showed that both age and education were significant predictors of performance. Therefore, norms were calculated taking into account these demographic variables. The availability of normative data based on a large sample will allow a more reliable use of the battery for clinical assessment in Italian-speaking dementia population.

AB The ability to recognize emotional facial expressions is crucial to adequate social behavior. Previous studies have suggested deficits in emotion recognition in multiple sclerosis (MS). These deficits were accompanied by several confounders including cognitive or visual impairments, disease duration, and depression. In our study we used functional MRI (fMRI) to test for potential early adaptive changes in only mildly disabled MS patients performing an emotion recognition task including the facial expressions of the emotions anger, fear and disgust. Fifteen relapsing-remitting MS patients with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2 (range: 0-3.5) and 15 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, gender, and education underwent behavioral (BERT: behavioral emotion recognition test; BRB-N: Brief Repeatable Battery for neuropsychological tests, WCST: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) and clinical assessments (BDI: Beck Depression Inventory). Conventional MRI at 3.0T served to assess whole-brain volume, white matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and T2-lesion load; during fMRI, participants were confronted with neutral, scrambled, angry, disgusted, and fearful faces, and houses. In the absence of differences in cognitive performance and in the ability to accurately recognize distinct emotional facial expressions, MS patients demonstrated excess fMRI activations during facial recognition compared to HC. These differences concerned the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus for anger and disgust contrasted to neutral faces, and the occipital fusiform gyri and the anterior CC for neutral faces versus houses. This study provides first evidence for excess activation during processing of higher order visual stimuli of emotional content in the absence of emotional, visual or cognitive behavior abnormalities already in earlier stages of MS.

AB Background: Malaria is a leading cause of ill health and neuro-disability in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Impaired cognition is a common outcome of malaria with neurological involvement. There is also a possibility that academic achievement may be affected by malaria with neurological involvement given the association between cognitive ability and academic achievement. This study investigated the effect of malaria with neurological involvement on cognitive ability, behaviour and academic achievement.
   Methods: This prospective case-control study was carried out in Kampala City, Uganda between February 2008 and October 2010. Sixty-two children with a history of malaria with neurological involvement were followed up and given assessments for cognitive ability (working memory, reasoning, learning, visual spatial skills and attention), behaviour (internalizing and externalizing problems) and academic achievement (arithmetic, spelling and reading) three months after the illness. Sixty-one community controls recruited from the homes or neighbouring families of the cases were also given the same assessments. Tests scores of the two groups were compared using analysis of covariance with age, sex, level of education, nutritional status and quality of the home environment as covariates. This study was approved by the relevant ethical bodies and informed consent sought from the caregivers.
   Results: Children in the malaria group had more behavioural problems than the community controls for internalizing problems (estimated mean difference = -3.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), = -6.34 to -1.08, p = 0.007). There was marginal evidence of lower attention scores (0.40, CI = -0.05 to 0.86, p = 0.09). However, excluding one child from the analyses who was unable to perform the tests affected the attention scores to borderline significance (0.32, CI, = 0.01 to 0.62, p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other cognitive abilities or in academic achievement scores.
   Conclusion: Malaria with neurological involvement affects behaviour, with a minimal effect on attention but no detectable effect on academic achievement at three months post discharge. This study provides evidence that development of cognitive deficits after malaria with neurological involvement could be gradual with less effect observed in the short term compared to the long term.

AB Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a characteristic symptom in schizophrenia, and also occur in the general, non-clinical population. In schizophrenia patients, several specific cognitive deficits, such as in speech processing, working memory, source memory, attention, inhibition, episodic memory and self-monitoring have been associated with auditory verbal hallucinations. Such associations are interesting, as they may identify specific cognitive traits that constitute a predisposition for AVH. However, it is difficult to disentangle a specific relation with AVH in patients with schizophrenia, as so many other factors can affect the performance on cognitive tests. Examining the cognitive profile of healthy individuals experiencing AVH may reveal a more direct association between AVH and aberrant cognitive functioning in a specific domain. For the current study, performance in executive functioning, memory (both short- and long-term), processing speed, spatial ability, lexical access, abstract reasoning, language and intelligence performance was compared between 101 healthy individuals with AVH and 101 healthy controls, matched for gender, age, handedness and education.
   Although performance of both groups was within the normal range, not clinically impaired, significant differences between the groups were found in the verbal domain as well as in executive functioning. Performance on all other cognitive domains was similar in both groups. The predisposition to experience AVH is associated with lower performance in executive functioning and aberrant language performance. This association might be related to difficulties in the inhibition of irrelevant verbal information. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Objective: Upper-limb paresis is a major source of disability in stroke survivors, and robotic device-aided exercise therapy is a promising approach to enhance motor abilities. Few robotic devices have been available to provide therapy to the fingers and hand. This study was designed to test a new robotic device for hand rehabilitation in stroke survivors.
   Design: This is an open-label pilot study of 12 individuals with chronic moderate hemiparesis after stroke. Participants underwent a 6-wk training program using a hand robotic device. Participants received a total of 18 hrs of robotic therapy.
   Results: Improvements were found in multiple measures of motor performance, including the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer test, the Motor Activity Log, the Manual Ability Measure-36, and the Jebsen Hand Function Test. All subjects tolerated the treatment well and no complications were observed.
   Conclusions: Robotic therapy for hand paresis after stroke is safe and feasible, and further studies of efficacy are justified by these preliminary results. Key Words: Stroke, Hemiparesis, Robotics, Rehabilitation

TI Effects of atypical antipsychotics on neurocognition in euthymic bipolar

AB Background: Different factors may influence cognitive functioning in bipolar disorder such as the effect of subsyndromal symptoms, the history of psychotic symptomatology or substance abuse, negative symptomatology, chronicity, sleep disturbances, and hormonal factors. The effect of pharmacologic treatment on cognition is still uncertain because of an insufficient number of studies examining this issue.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to compare neuropsychologic performance of treated bipolar patients with that of controls, including unmedicated patients and healthy subjects, as well as to evaluate possible neurocognitive differences among 3 different atypical antipsychotics.
   Research Design and Methods: A total of 119 subjects were included in the study. Of 79 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition euthymic bipolar patients, 68 were treated with one atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine (n = 12), olanzapine (n = 26), or risperidone (n = 30). Sixteen patients were drug-free. The 4 groups were compared with a sample of drug-naive patients and a healthy control group (n = 35) on several clinical and neuropsychologic variables, especially on the domains of attention, verbal memory, and executive functions. Euthymia was defined by a score of 6 or less at the Young Mania Rating Scale and a score of 8 or less at the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for at least 6 months.
   Results: The 5 groups did not differ in age, years of education, sex distribution, or estimated premorbid 1Q. The 4 patients groups did not differ in chronicity, age of onset, total number of episodes, and number of hospitalizations. No differences were found regarding antipsychotic dosages between the groups. Bipolar patients performed poorly on most neuropsychologic measures as compared with healthy controls. After controlling for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale symptoms, no significant change in the results was observed. Because many patients with antipsychotic treatment had a history of psychotic symptoms, we performed multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for this variable. Bipolar patients taking 1 of the 3 antipsychotics presented with dose-independent significant deficits in most cognitive tasks compared with healthy controls. After several head-to-head group comparisons, the patients receiving quetiapine showed a better performance in learning task, short-term memory, and recognition task assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test and verbal fluency (P < .05).
   Conclusions: Our results confirm the findings of previous studies of cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder. Untreated euthymic patients showed better cognitive performance than did patients on atypical antipsychotics. Some iatrogenic-pharmacologic effect, therefore, cannot be excluded, but quetiapine seemed to be less associated with impairment in measures of verbal memory than olanzapine or risperidone. We suggest to use drugs in bipolar disorder with a lower risk of cognitive adverse effects. However, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to give a definite answer to this critical problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: It has been suggested that women have a better face recognition memory than men. Here we analyzed whether this advantage depends on a better encoding or consolidation of information and if the advantage is visible during short-term memory (STM), only, or whether it also remains evident in long-term memory (LTM). Method: We tested short- and long-term face recognition memory in 36 nonclinical participants (19 women). We varied the duration of item presentation (1, 5, and 10 s), the time of testing (immediately after the study phase, 1 hr, and 24 hr later), and the possibility to reencode items (none, immediately after the study phase, after 1 hr). Results: Women showed better overall face recognition memory than men (eta(2)(p) = .15, p < .05). We found this advantage, however, only with a longer duration of item presentation (interaction effect Sex X Duration: eta(2)(p) = .16, p < .05). Women's advantage in face recognition was visible mainly if participants had the possibility to reencode faces during former test trials. Conclusions: Our results suggest women do not have a better face recognition memory than men per se, but may profit more than men from longer durations of presentation during encoding or the possibility for reencoding. Future research on sex differences in face recognition memory should explicate possible causes for the better encoding of face information in women.

AB Background: Binge drinking is prevalent during adolescence, and its effect on neurocognitive development is of concern. In adult and adolescent populations, heavy substance use has been associated with decrements in cognitive functioning, particularly on tasks of spatial working memory (SWM). Characterizing the gender-specific influences of heavy episodic drinking on SWM may help elucidate the early functional consequences of drinking on adolescent brain functioning.
   Methods: Forty binge drinkers (13 females, 27 males) and 55 controls (24 females, 31 males), aged 16 to 19 years, completed neuropsychological testing, substance use interviews, and an SWM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Significant binge drinking status x gender interactions were found (p < 0.05) in 8 brain regions spanning bilateral frontal, anterior cingulate, temporal, and cerebellar cortices. In all regions, female binge drinkers showed less SWM activation than female controls, while male bingers exhibited greater SWM response than male controls. For female binge drinkers, less activation was associated with poorer sustained attention and working memory performances (p < 0.025). For male binge drinkers, greater activation was linked to better spatial performance (p < 0.025).
   Conclusion: Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with gender-specific differences in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar brain activation during an SWM task, which in turn relate to cognitive performance. Activation correlates with neuropsychological performance, strengthening the argument that blood oxygen level-dependent activation is affected by alcohol use and is an important indicator of behavioral functioning. Females may be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of heavy alcohol use during adolescence, while males may be more resilient to the deleterious effects of binge drinking. Future longitudinal research will examine the significance of SWM brain activation as an early neurocognitive marker of alcohol impact to the brain on future behaviors, such as driving safety, academic performance, and neuropsychological performance.

AB This study was aimed at examining spatial learning and memory in nonoperated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Twenty-five patients with a refractory epileptic focus located in the temporal lobe (10 in the right hemisphere and 15 in the left hemisphere) and 25 healthy age-matched controls performed the "Boxes Room," a virtual reality version of the holeboard. They were trained in 10 trials to locate the reward boxes in a room with 16 of them available. Participants also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Patients performed significantly worse relative to the control group. They traveled longer distances and committed more errors than controls. No differences in performance were found within the TLE group when gender or lateralization of the epileptic focus was considered an independent variable. These findings suggest that the integrity of temporal structures in both hemispheres could be critical to spatial learning and memory and support the spatial component of the task.

AB Results from a number of studies have suggested a relationship between cognitive alteration and benzodiazepine use in the elderly. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of benzodiazepine use on cognitive functions in a young adult population.
   This study included 1,019 French salaried workers from the VISAT (Aging, Health and Work) cohort whose objective was to determine the long-term impact of working conditions on health and aging. Data were collected during interviews by occupational physicians in 1996, 2001 and 2006. Cognitive function was assessed using five cognitive tests (immediate free recall test, delayed free recall test, recognition test, Digit Symbol Substitution Subtest and visual search speed test). Cognitive scores obtained after a 10-year follow-up were investigated among three categories of benzodiazepine users, namely, non-users, occasional users and long-term users, using analysis of covariance models adjusted for several potential confounders in men and women separately.
   In the course of the 10 year-follow-up, 3.9% of subjects were defined as occasional users of benzodiazepine and 7.5% as long-term users. The analysis revealed a significant alteration of long-term memory in women whereas there was no significant association in men.
   Long-term use of benzodiazepine leads to specific impairment in long-term memory only in women.

AB The hippocampus plays a significant role in spatial memory processing, with sex differences being prominent on various spatial tasks. This study examined sex differences in healthy adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in areas implicated in spatial processing during navigation of a virtual analogue of the Morris water-maze. There were three conditions: learning, hidden, and visible control. There were no significant differences in performance measures. However, sex differences were found in regional brain activation during learning in the right hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and the cingulate cortex. During the hidden condition, the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyros, and cingulate cortex were activated in both men and women. Additional brain areas involved in spatial processing may be recruited in women when learning information about the environment, by utilizing external cues (landmarks) more than do men, contributing to the observed sex differences in brain activation.

AB Background: The Minho Integrative Neuroscience Database (MIND)-Ageing project aims to identify predictors of healthy cognitive ageing, including socio-demographic factors. In this exploratory analysis we sought to establish baseline cohorts for longitudinal assessment of age-related changes in cognition.
   Methods: The population sample (472 individuals) was strictly a convenient one, but similar to the Portuguese population in the age profile. Participants older than 55 years of age were included if they did not present defined disabling pathologies or dementia. A standardized clinical interview was conducted to assess medical history and a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to characterize global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination), memory and executive functions (Selective Reminding Test; Stroop Color and Word Test; and Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). Cross-sectional analysis of the neuropsychological performance with individual characteristics such as age, gender, educational level and setting (retirement home, senior university, day care center or community), allowed the establishment of baseline clusters for subsequent longitudinal studies.
   Results: Based on different socio-demographic characteristics, four main clusters that group distinctive patterns of cognitive performance were identified. The type of institution where the elders were sampled from, together with the level of formal education, were the major hierarchal factors for individual distribution in the four clusters. Of notice, education seems to delay the cognitive decline that is associated with age in all clusters.
   Conclusions: Social-inclusion/engagement and education seem to have a protective effect on mental ageing, although this effect may not be effective in the eldest elders.

AB Sex differences in the latent general and broad cognitive abilities underlying the Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition were investigated for children and youth ages 5 through 17. Multi-group mean and covariance structural equation modeling was used to investigate sex differences in latent cognitive abilities as well as changes in these differences across age. Most broad abilities showed mean differences across the sexes, and all such differences varied across ages. Girls showed an advantage on the processing speed (Gs) first-order residual factor. Girls also showed advantages at some ages on free-recall memory, a narrow ability of long term retrieval (Glr). Boys showed a developmentally-related advantage on a visual-spatial ability (Gv) first-order residual factor, depending on age. Younger girls showed an advantage on short-term memory (Gsm). No statistically significant sex differences were shown on the latent comprehension-knowledge (Gc) factor, or on a second-order, latent g factor. Boys showed larger variances for several broad abilities, some substantial, but those differences were not statistically significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have evidenced an increasing interest in sex-related brain mechanisms and cerebral lateralization subserving emotional memory, language processing, and conversational behavior. We used event-related-potentials (ERP) to examine the influence of sex and hemisphere on brain responses to emotional stimuli. Given that the P300 component of ERP is considered a cognitive neuroelectric phenomenon, we compared left and right hemisphere P300 responses to emotional stimuli in men and women. As indexed by both amplitude and latency measures, emotional stimuli elicited more robust P300 effects in the left hemisphere in women than in men, while a stronger P300 component was elicited in the right hemisphere in men compared to women. Our findings show that the variables of sex and hemisphere interacted significantly to influence the strength of the P300 component to the emotional stimuli. Emotional stimuli were also best recalled when given a long-term, incidental memory test, a fact potentially related to the differential P300 waves at encoding. Moreover, taking into account the sex-related differences in language processing and conversational behavior, in the present study we evaluated possible talkativeness differences between the two genders in the recollection of emotional stimuli. Our data showed that women used a higher number of words, compared to men, to describe both arousal and neutral stories. Moreover, the present results support the view that sex differences in lateralization may not be a general feature of language processing but may be related to the specific condition, such as the emotional content of stimuli.

AB The present study focuses on the short-term effects of electronic entertainment media on memory and learning processes. It compares the effects of violent versus nonviolent computer game content in a condition of playing and in another condition of watching the same game. The participants consisted of 83 female and 94 male adolescents with a mean age of 17.6 years. The dependent variables are memory for previously learnt verbal and visual material, memory for media-related content and physiological measures of stress (heart rate, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase). Besides the group comparisons, potential mediation effects and gender differences were examined. The results show that violent content leads to a poorer memory performance for verbal material and to an increased heart rate. The heart rate, however, does not mediate the effect on memory performance. Genders differ regarding their abilities to memorise verbal and visual material, with females showing a better performance (independent of the experimental condition), and for memorising media-contents, where the males outperform females (also independent of experimental condition). The study supports the assumption that violent and arousing media content has a negative short-term effect on simultaneous information processing and learning and that there are gender-specific media effects.

AB This study examined the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and executive functioning on episodic memory in a group of older adults who were cognitively normal or diagnosed with MCI or dementia. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of total brain volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, and hippocampal volume along with age, education, and gender were evaluated as predictors of episodic memory. WMH were found to influence both episodic memory and executive functioning independently of other variables. The influence WMH on episodic memory was mediated by executive functioning and was completely eliminated when the interaction between executive functioning and hippocampal volume was entered in the regression model. The results indicate that executive functioning mediates the effects of WMH on episodic memory but that executive functioning and hippocampal volume can also interact such that executive functioning can exacerbate or ameliorate the influence of hippocampal volume on episodic memory.

AB Essential tremor is a common neurological disorder characterized by motor and cognitive symptoms including working memory deficits. Epidemiological research has shown that patients with essential tremor are at a higher risk to develop dementia relative to age-matched individuals; this demonstrates that cognitive impairments reflect specific, although poorly understood, disease mechanisms. Neurodegeneration of the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of essential tremor itself; however, whether cerebellar dysfunctions relate to cognitive abnormalities is unclear. We addressed this issue using functional neuroimaging in 15 patients with essential tremor compared to 15 sex-, education- and age-matched healthy controls while executing a verbal working memory task. To remove confounding effects, patients with integrity of the nigrostriatal terminals, no dementia and abstinent from medications altering cognition were enrolled. We tested whether patients displayed abnormal activations of the cerebellum (posterior lobules) and other areas typically engaged in working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal lobules). Between-groups differences in the interactions of these regions were also assessed with functional connectivity methods. Finally, we determined whether individual differences in neuropsychological and clinical measures modulated the magnitude of regional brain responses and functional connectivity data in patients with essential tremor. Despite similar behavioural performances, patients showed greater cerebellar response (crus I/lobule VI) compared to controls during attentional-demanding working memory trials (F = 8.8; P < 0.05, corrected). They also displayed altered functional connectivity between crus I/lobule VI and regions implicated in focusing attention (executive control circuit including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, thalamus) and in generating distracting self-related thoughts (default mode network including precuneus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) (T-values > 3.2; P < 0.05, corrected). These findings were modulated by the variability in neuropsychological measures: patients with low cognitive scores displayed reduced connectivity between crus I/lobule VI and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and enhanced connectivity between crus I/lobule VI and the precuneus (T-values > 3.7; P < 0.05, corrected). It is likely that cerebellar neurodegeneration underlying essential tremor is reflected in abnormal communications between key regions responsible for working memory and that adaptive mechanisms (enhanced response of crus I/lobule VI) occur to limit the expression of cognitive symptoms. The connectivity imbalance between the executive control circuit and the default mode network in patients with essential tremor with low cognitive scores may represent a dysfunction, driven by the cerebellum, in suppressing task irrelevant thoughts via focused attention. Overall, our results offer new insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of cognition in essential tremor and suggest a primary role of the cerebellum in mediating abnormal interactions between the executive control circuit and the default mode network.

AB The experimental study reported here employed one of the most compelling visual cues of female sexual attractiveness (low waist-to-hip ratio) to test the influence of news anchor sexualization on audience evaluations of her as a professional and their memory for the news that she presents. Male participants saw the sexualized version of the anchor as less suited for war and political reporting. They also encoded less news information presented by the sexualized than her unsexualized version. Conclusions were drawn in line with evolutionary psychology expectations of men's cognitive susceptibility to visual sex cues. Women participants, on the other hand, did not vary across conditions in their assessments of the anchor's competence to report on war and political news. Moreover, they encoded more news information presented by the sexualized than unsexualized anchor condition.

AB Memory Island and the Novel-Image Novel-Location are recently developed measures of spatial learning and recognition-memory modeled after the Morris water maze and the novel object-recognition tests. The goal of this study was to characterize how sex, age, and handedness contribute to Memory Island and Novel-Image Novel-Location performance. Volunteers (N=287, ages 6 to 67) from a local science museum completed four Memory Island trials containing a visible target and four trials containing a hidden target. A pronounced sex difference favoring males was noted in all measures of hidden trial performance. The total latency during the hidden trials among older-adults was longer than younger-adults or adolescents. Faster and more efficient performance by males was also identified during the visible trials, particularly among children. Adolescents and younger-adults outperformed children and older ages. Sinistrals had a lower cumulative distance to the target. Novel-Image Novel-Location behavior was examined in a separate sample (N=128, ages 6 to 86). Females had higher Novel-Image and Novel-Location scores than males. Novel-Image performance was independent of age while sinistrals had elevated Novel-Image scores relative to dextrals. Together, these findings identify how sex, age, and handedness uniquely contribute to performance on these tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate sex differences in neurocognition and social functioning in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and the possible role of sex as a moderator of this relationship. Method: Participants with schizophrenia (60 women/94 men), bipolar I disorder (55 women/51 men), and healthy controls (158 women/182 men) were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery and a social functioning questionnaire. Results: We found significant main effects of sex for neuropsychological tests (p < .001, eta(2) = 0.10) and social functioning (p < .001, eta(2) = 0.05), with men scoring below women. Women performed better than men for all neuropsychological tests (except attention and working memory). Both clinical groups performed below healthy controls for all neuropsychological tests (except attention). Post hoc comparisons of persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls yielded significant interaction effects (p < .05) for three neuropsychological tests (California Verbal Learning Test II [CVLT-II], Color-Word Interference, and Interference/Switching), with men with schizophrenia being disproportionally disadvantaged compared with their female counterparts. Regression analyses investigating sex as a moderator between neurocognition and social functioning showed that neurocognition predicted social functioning in schizophrenia, whereas sex predicted social functioning in healthy controls. Sex was not a moderator in any of the three groups. Conclusions: This study is the first to find neurocognitive sex differences for bipolar disorder and replicated previous findings for schizophrenia. The data did not support the hypothesis that sex is a moderator between neurocognition and social functioning. Clinical implications include the use of different cognitive remediation strategies based on sex.

AB The potential effect of gender on intellectual abilities remains controversial. The purpose of this research was to analyze gender differences in cognitive test performance among children from continuous age groups. For this purpose, the normative data from 7 domains of the newly developed neuropsychological test battery, the Evaluacion Neuropsicologica Infantil [Child Neuropsychological Assessment] (Matute, Rosselli, Ardila, & Ostrosky-Solis, 2007), were analyzed. The sample included 788 monolingual children (350 boys, 438 girls) ages 5 to 16 years from Mexico and Colombia. Gender differences were observed in oral language (language expression and language comprehension), spatial abilities (recognition of pictures seen from different angles), and visual (Object Integration Test) and tactile perceptual tasks, with boys outperforming girls in most cases, except for the tactile tasks. Gender accounted for only a very small percentage of the variance (1%-3%). Gender X Age interactions were observed for the tactile tasks only. It was concluded that gender differences during cognitive development are minimal, appear in only a small number of tests, and account for only a low percentage of the score variance.

AB Rationale Long-term heavy cannabis use can result in memory impairment. Adolescent users may be especially vulnerable to the adverse neurocognitive effects of cannabis.
   Objectives and methods In a cross-sectional and prospective neuropsychological study of 181 adolescents aged 16-20 (mean 18.3 years), we compared performance indices from one of the most widely used measures of learning and memory-the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-between cannabis users (n=52; mean 2.4 years of use, 14 days/month, median abstinence 20.3 h), alcohol users (n=67) and non-user controls (n=62) matched for age, education and premorbid intellectual ability (assessed prospectively), and alcohol consumption for cannabis and alcohol users.
   Results Cannabis users performed significantly worse than alcohol users and non-users on all performance indices. They recalled significantly fewer words overall (p<0.001), demonstrating impaired learning (p<0.001), retention (p<0.001) and retrieval (p<0.05) (Cohen's d 0.43-0.84). The degree of impairment was associated with the duration, quantity, frequency and age of onset of cannabis use, but was unrelated to alcohol exposure or other drug use. No gender effects were detected and the findings remained after controlling for premorbid intellectual ability. An earlier age of onset of regular cannabis use was associated with worse memory performance after controlling for extent of exposure to cannabis.
   Conclusions Despite relatively brief exposure, adolescent cannabis users relative to their age-matched counterparts demonstrated similar memory deficits to those reported in adult long-term heavy users. The results indicate that cannabis adversely affects the developing brain and reinforce concerns regarding the impact of early exposure.

AB Women have consistently demonstrated better verbal memory on tests that evaluate immediate and delayed free recall. In patients with schizophrenia, these verbal memory processes are relatively more preserved in women than men. However an understanding of the brain anatomy of the female advantage for verbal memory is still unclear.
   29 females and 59 males with schizophrenia made comparable to 21 female and 27 male healthy volunteers were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) in order to assess volumes of regions across the entire brain. Sex differences within and between groups in the covariance structure of memory circuitry regions were evaluated using a novel approach to covariance analysis (the Box M Test). Brain areas of interest included the prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior parietal lobule (iPAR), anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), parahippocampus, and hippocampus (HIPP).
   Results showed significant differences in the covariance matrices of females and males with schizophrenia compared with their healthy counterparts, in particular the relationships between iPAR-PFC, iPAR-ACG, and HIPP-PFC. Sex differences in the iPAR-PFC relationship were significantly associated with sex differences in verbal memory performance. In control women, but not in men ACG volume correlated strongly with memory performance. In schizophrenia, ACG volume was reduced in females, but not in men, relative to controls.
   Findings suggest that the relationship between iPAR and PFC is particularly important for understanding the relative preservation of verbal memory processing in females with schizophrenia and may compensate for ACG volume reductions. These results illustrate the utility of a unique covariance structure modeling approach that yields important new knowledge for understanding the nature of schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Fatigue is a common complaint among elementary and junior high school students, and is known to be associated with reduced academic performance. Recently, we demonstrated that fatigue was correlated with decreased cognitive function in these students. However, no studies have identified cognitive predictors of fatigue. Therefore, we attempted to determine independent cognitive predictors of fatigue in these students.
   Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study. One hundred and forty-two elementary and junior high school students without fatigue participated. They completed a variety of paper-and-pencil tests, including list learning and list recall tests, kana pick-out test, semantic fluency test, figure copying test, digit span forward test, and symbol digit modalities test. The participants also completed computerized cognitive tests (tasks A to E on the modified advanced trail making test). These cognitive tests were used to evaluate motor-and information-processing speed, immediate and delayed memory function, auditory and visual attention, divided and switching attention, retrieval of learned material, and spatial construction. One year after the tests, a questionnaire about fatigue (Japanese version of the Chalder Fatigue Scale) was administered to all the participants.
   Results: After the follow-up period, we confirmed 40 cases of fatigue among 118 students. In multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for grades and gender, poorer performance on visual information-processing speed and attention tasks was associated with increased risk of fatigue.
   Conclusions: Reduced visual information-processing speed and poor attention are independent predictors of fatigue in elementary and junior high school students.

AB Introduction: Previous neuropsychological, lesional and functional imaging studies deal with the lateralization of memory processes, suggesting that they could be determined by the stage of processing (encoding vs retrieval) or by content (verbal vs non-verbal stimuli). The aims of the present study were: 1) to investigate if tasks that can be carried out using different strategies depending on the verbalizability of the material induce a lateralization of the mean cerebral blood flow velocity (mCBFV) in the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs), as monitored by a functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD); 2) to evaluate if these patterns of cerebral activation differ in relation to age, gender and task performance.
   Method: Using TCD bilateral monitoring, we recorded mCBFV variations in 35 male and 35 female healthy, right-handed volunteers, classified as "young" (age range 21-40 years, n = 35) or "old"(age range 41-60 years, n = 35), performing four different cognitive tasks: encoding and recognition of Geometric Figures (GF), encoding and recall of Object Localization (OL) on a picture, encoding of a verbal Room Description (RD) and Arithmetic Skill (AS).
   Results: We found a significant right lateralization for the OL recall phase, and a significant left lateralization for RD and AS. When we took into consideration gender, age and performance, there was a strong effect of age on both OL encoding and recall phase, with significant right lateralization in young volunteers not seen in the older ones. No difference in gender was detected. We found a gender x performance interaction for RD, with poor performance females showing significant left lateralization.
   Conclusions: According to our findings, hemispheric lateralization during memory encoding is material specific in both men and women, depending on the verbalizability of the material. mCBFV right lateralization during scene encoding and recall appears lost in older people, suggesting that healthy elderly could take advantage of mixed verbal and nonverbal strategies.

AB Previous research has demonstrated a female advantage, albeit imperfectly, on tests of object location memory where object identity information is readily available. However, spatial and visual elements are often confounded in the experimental tasks used. Here spatial and visual memory performance was compared in 30 men and 30 women by presenting 12 abstract designs in a spatial array for recall and recognition (visual memory) and spatial location ("object" location memory). Object location memory was measured via a sensitive absolute displacement score defined as the distance in mms between the position assigned to the object during recall and the actual position it originally occupied. There were no sex differences in either the visual or spatial location tests. Controlling for age and estimated IQ scores made no impact on the results. These data suggest an absence of a sex difference in purely visual and spatial aspects of object location memory. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study was aimed at investigating the spatial abilities in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) by using the Radial Arm Maze (RAM) task. We trained PWS individuals with the deletion subtype in two different RAM paradigms that tapped different aspects of spatial memory. To evaluate the extent of spatial deficit in PWS individuals, it seemed interesting to compare their performances with those of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) in which deficits in spatial abilities have been well described. The two syndromic groups were compared to typically developing (TD) individuals mental-age and gender matched. The findings evidenced the impairment of PWS individuals in solving the RAM task with variable severity depending on the paradigm requests. Since the RAM is a task that allows the acquisition of spatial competences through the movement, we advance that the spatial deficits observed in PWS individuals may be related to the malfunctioning of spatial and motor integrative processing.

AB Deficits in episodic memory, related to medial temporal lobe dysfunction, are a core component of schizophrenia. Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is one of the most widely used neuropsychological memory tasks in clinical practice but normative data are limited. Over the last 15 years, the RAVLT has been used to assess verbal episodic memory performance as part of the Western Australian Family Study of Schizophrenia (WAFSS). This study aims to provide RAVLT norms, derived from the WAFSS, for individuals meeting DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, for use in clinical settings. Performance on three immediate and one delayed recall trials, and additional measures of encoding and forgetting, is presented for 492 patients and 260 healthy community controls. Results indicated that age and sex (both groups) and IQ (schizophrenia group only) significantly influenced performance. Norms are presented, as means and standard deviations, stratified accordingly. Additional between-groups analysis clearly shows a significant memory deficit in schizophrenia even when patients are matched on IQ, age, and sex with healthy controls.

AB Background: Fibrillar amyloid deposition preferentially affects the frontal lobes, temporal pole/neocortex, and posterior cingulate by age 65 years in APOE epsilon 4 carriers prior to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD), but is it impairing frontally mediated neuropsychological performance?
   Methods: A total of 71 epsilon 4 homozygotes (HMZ), 194 epsilon 4 heterozygotes (HTZ), and 356 epsilon 4 noncarriers (NC) who did not differ significantly in mean age (56.6 years), years of education (15.6), gender (70% women), or follow-up duration (6.3 years) had neuropsychological testing every 2 years including the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and frontal/executive tasks sensitive to psychomotor speed, working memory, problem solving, and activity. A subset also received the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Findings were then tested in a clinical sample of 27 patients with incident MCI and AD.
   Results: APOE epsilon 4 carriers had greater acceleration of decline (quadratic effect) than NC on the AVLT (p = 0.04) but not on any frontal test. APOE epsilon 4 HMZ had greater velocity of decline (linear effects) than NC on all mental arithmetic tests: paced auditory serial attention task (PASAT) 3 second (p = 0.01) and 2 second (p = 0.004) versions; and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised arithmetic (p = 0.048). IGT performance did not differ between 12 epsilon 4 HMZ, 27 epsilon 4 HTZ, and 44 NC. Among 27 patients with incident MCI and AD, the PASAT showed progressive decline preceding diagnosis in 50%.
   Conclusions: No frontal cognitive effects were as robust as memory decline. APOE epsilon 4 HMZ declined more quickly than NC on mental arithmetic tests related to frontal lobe-mediated working memory ability. Neurology (R) 2011; 76: 1383-1388

AB Prior research has demonstrated robust sex and sexual orientation-related differences in object location memory in humans. Here we show that this sexual variation may depend on the spatial position of target objects and the task-specific nature of the spatial array. We tested the recovery of object locations in three object arrays (object exchanges, object shifts, and novel objects) relative to veridical center (left compared to right side of the arrays) in a sample of 35 heterosexual men, 35 heterosexual women, and 35 homosexual men. Relative to heterosexual men, heterosexual women showed better location recovery in the right side of the array during object exchanges and homosexual men performed better in the right side during novel objects. However, the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men disappeared after controlling for IQ. Heterosexual women and homosexual men did not differ significantly from each other in location change detection with respect to task or side of array. These data suggest that visual space biases in processing categorical spatial positions may enhance aspects of object location memory in heterosexual women. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The research focused on sex differences in the accuracy and quantity of memory recall for specific details of an event. The respondent sample included 280 participants (57.5% females and 42.5% males) with an average age of 19 years. The participants were shown a two-minute recording of a violent robbery, supposedly captured by a surveillance camera, and told their help was needed in verifying hypotheses for the criminal investigation. The results have shown that, overall, females are more reliable eyewitnesses than males. Most notably, females outperformed males in the accuracy of person descriptions, particularly in victim descriptions. Males were more accurate in describing the event and also more confident in their memory, especially when describing the place of the incident. However, male confidence was unjustified because females showed a higher degree of accuracy also in place descriptions. The quantity of recalled details revealed no sex differences, probably because a checklist was used to evaluate memory recall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The prognostic implications of cognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not established.
   Objectives: To investigate the survival effect of the comorbid frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and to determine whether, in the absence of dementia, impairment in different cognitive domains affects outcome.
   Methods: A prospective population-based study of incident cases of ALS in the Republic of Ireland included home-based neuropsychological assessments using age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. Four cognitive domains were evaluated: executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial skills.
   Results: Mean age of the participants (n = 139) was 63.3 years; 61.2% were male and 35.3% had bulbar-onset ALS. Factors associated with shorter survival included age more than 60, severe disability at baseline, shorter delay to diagnosis, and early respiratory involvement. Comorbid FTD was associated with significantly shorter survival time (hazard ratio [HR] 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-6.85, p = 0.041). In patients with ALS without dementia, the presence of executive dysfunction was significantly associated with shorter survival. This was confirmed in a multivariate model that included age, delay to diagnosis, disease severity at baseline, education, and respiratory status (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.45-8.18, p = 0.005). In the absence of executive dysfunction, single or multi-domain impairment in other cognitive domains had no significant effect on survival.
   Conclusion: Comorbid frontotemporal dementia is a negative prognostic indicator. In patients with ALS without dementia, executive dysfunction, but not impairment in other cognitive domains, is an important negative prognostic indicator. Neurology (R) 2011;76:1263-1269

AB Objectives: MRI white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume is associated with cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that specific loci of WMH would correlate with cognition even after accounting for total WMH volume.
   Methods: Subjects were identified from a prospective community-based study: 40 had normal cognition, 94 had mild impairment (defined here as a Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score of 0.5 without dementia), and 11 had mild Alzheimer's dementia. Factor analysis of a 22-item neuropsychological battery yielded 4 factors (episodic memory, executive function, spatial skills, and general knowledge). MRI WMH segmentation and analysis was performed using FreeSurfer software.
   Results: Higher WMH volume was independently associated with lower executive function and episodic memory factor scores. Voxel-based general linear models showed loci where WMH was strongly inversely associated with specific cognitive factor scores (p < 0.001), controlling for age, education, sex, APOE genotype, and total WMH volume. For episodic memory, clusters were observed in bilateral temporal-occipital and right parietal periventricular white matter, and the left anterior limb of the internal capsule. For executive function, clusters were observed in bilateral inferior frontal white matter, bilateral temporal-occipital and right parietal periventricular white matter, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally.
   Conclusions: Specific WMH loci are closely associated with executive function and episodic memory, independent of total WMH volume. The anatomic locations suggest that WMH may cause cognitive impairment by affecting connections between cortex and subcortical structures, including the thalamus and striatum, or connections between the occipital lobe and frontal or parietal lobes.

   CANNABIS
AB Aims
   In field studies assessing cognitive function in illicit ecstasy users, there are several frequent confounding factors that might plausibly bias the findings toward an overestimate of ecstasy-induced neurocognitive toxicity. We designed an investigation seeking to minimize these possible sources of bias.
   Design
   We compared illicit ecstasy users and non-users while (1) excluding individuals with significant life-time exposure to other illicit drugs or alcohol; (2) requiring that all participants be members of the 'rave' subculture; and (3) testing all participants with breath, urine and hair samples at the time of evaluation to exclude possible surreptitious substance use. We compared groups with adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, family-of-origin variables and childhood history of conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We provide significance levels without correction for multiple comparisons.
   Setting
   Field study.
   Participants
   Fifty-two illicit ecstasy users and 59 non-users, aged 18-45 years.
   Measurements
   Battery of 15 neuropsychological tests tapping a range of cognitive functions.
   Findings
   We found little evidence of decreased cognitive performance in ecstasy users, save for poorer strategic self-regulation, possibly reflecting increased impulsivity. However, this finding might have reflected a pre-morbid attribute of ecstasy users, rather than a residual neurotoxic effect of the drug.
   Conclusions
   In a study designed to minimize limitations found in many prior investigations, we failed to demonstrate marked residual cognitive effects in ecstasy users. This finding contrasts with many previous findings-including our own-and emphasizes the need for continued caution in interpreting field studies of cognitive function in illicit ecstasy users.

   RECOLLECTION; ADULTS; JUDGMENTS; RECALL; ERP; CONSCIOUSNESS
AB We examined the ERP correlates of familiarity and recollection and their development in 8- to 10-year-old children and a control group of young adults. Capitalizing on the different temporal dynamics of familiarity and recollection, we tested recognition memory in both groups with a speeded and nonspeeded response condition. Consistent with the view that familiarity is available earlier than recollection and by this more relevant for speeded recognition judgments, adults and children showed an early frontal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of familiarity in the speeded response condition. No parietal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of recollection was obtained in the speeded condition in neither group. Conversely, in the nonspeeded condition, both groups showed the parietal old/new effect, and a frontal effect was additionally observed for adults. In light of the generally lower memory accuracy of the children, these data suggested that children use a weaker and less matured version of the same explicit memory network used by adults in which familiarity and recollection differentially contribute to speeded and nonspeeded recognition memory judgments.

AB Context
   Testing increases memory of a topic studied more than additional study or training. The mechanisms by which this occurs are not clearly understood. Testing can be stressful and studies suggest that the stress hormone cortisol has modulating effects on memory, predominantly in men. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills testing induce a cortisol increase, whether the cortisol increase enhances retention of CPR skills, and how this relates to gender.
   Methods
   We randomised a convenience sample of medical students attending a mandatory course to one intervention and one control group. Students received a 4-hour course on CPR skills. During the final half-hour of the intervention course, participants were tested in CPR scenarios, whereas the control group underwent additional training. We assessed learning outcomes 2 weeks later by rating student performance in a CPR scenario using a checklist and a single blinded assessor. We measured salivary cortisol pre-course, half an hour before the end of the course and post-course, and compared learning outcomes and cortisol responses between groups and genders.
   Results
   In total, 146 of 202 (72%) students completed the study. We found a significant difference in learning outcome between the intervention and control groups for both genders (mean +/- standard deviation, 5.0 +/- 3.5; p = 0.006). We found a significant effect of increase in cortisol on learning outcome in men. The correlation between learning outcome and cortisol increase was medium to large for men (r = 0.38), but not for women (r = - 0.05).
   Conclusions
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills testing induces a rise in cortisol in men, which is related to the better retention of skills in men. Cortisol modulates test-enhanced learning in men.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate the age-specific incidence of cognitive impairment, no dementia and mild cognitive impairment (CIND/MCI) in a large, community-based sample of older African Americans in Indianapolis, IN. A longitudinal, prospective, 2-stage design was used with follow-up assessments 2 and 5 years after the baseline. A total of 1668 participants completed the 2-year follow-up and a total of 1255 participants completed the 5-year follow-up. The person-years method was used to calculate incidence rates. The age-standardized, annual incidence of CIND/MCI was 4.95% (CI = 3.39-6.52) and the subtype of medically unexplained memory loss (single-domain and multidomain amnestic MCI) was 3.67% (CI 2.75-4.48). Rates increased with age (3.43% for participants aged 65 to 74 y, 6.44% from age 75 to 84 y, and 9.62% from age 85 + y), history of head injury [OR 2.37 (CI 1.31-4.29)], and history of depression [OR 2.22 (CI 1.16-4.25)] while increased years of schooling was protective [OR 0.91 (CI 0.85-0.97)]. Rates did not vary substantially by sex. Almost 1 in 20 elderly community-dwelling African Americans, and almost 1 in 10 of the oldest-old (85 + y) developed CIND/MCI each year in this cohort. Risk factors of age and education suggest exposures or mechanisms at both ends of the life span may be important variables in onset of CIND/MCI.

AB Critical factors affecting traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcome in children and adolescents are explored with an emphasis on an examination of age at injury as a predictor of memory functioning. Age at injury and other injury-related and demographic predictors (i.e., severity, time postinjury, gender, and socioeconomic status [SES]) of memory and achievement outcome were examined in 65 children and adolescents post-TBI compared to 65 age-matched noninjured controls. Although robust findings have been found for age at injury as a general predictor of outcome, age was not found to be a significant predictor of memory functioning following pediatric TBI. Structural equation modeling suggests that the most parsimonious model of post-TBI outcome contains two causally related latent variables: one defined by gender, SES, injury severity, and age at injury, and one defined by general cognitive functioning.

Norms for this measure, based on cognitively intact African Americans age >= 70 (Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project, N=372), European American participants age >= 66 (Cache County Study of Memory, Health and Aging, N=507), and European American CERAD clinic controls age >= 50 (N=182), are presented here. Performance varied by site; by sex, education, and age (African Americans in Indianapolis); education and age (Cache County European Americans); and only age (CERAD European American controls). Performance declined with increased age, within age with less education, and was poorer for women. Means, standard deviations, and percentiles are presented separately for each sample.

AB Background: Recent studies have shown that decreases in both letter fluency and category fluency may be present in addition to memory impairment in single-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, the clinical utility of these fluency measures is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine what, if any, diagnostic value letter and category fluency provide in differentiating single-domain aMCI from normal cognition. Methods: Data from 66 individuals [ 33 cognitively normal (CN) and 33 aMCI] between the ages of 66 and 87 years participating in the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were compared on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)-FAS and Category Fluency test, both in terms of raw and scaled scores. Results: Participants were matched on age, education and sex. Two-tailed independent sample t-tests found statistically significant differences between the CN and aMCI groups for both raw and scaled scores of COWAT-FAS and Category Fluency (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses found that COWAT-FAS and Category Fluency did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy when combined with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed recall. Conclusion: Although decreased COWAT-FAS and Category Fluency performance may be present in single-domain aMCI, these tests do not improve the ability of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed recall to differentiate aMCI from CN individuals.

AB Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may affect multiple neuropsychological domains. While amnestic MCI is associated with Alzheimer's disease, patterns of brain pathology in non-amnestic subtypes have been less studied. Twenty-three patients with attention/executive MCI (a/e MCI), seen at a university-based memory clinic, and 23 normal controls, matched according to age, gender, and education, were included in this study. All subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery, including tests of memory, attention and executive function, and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging derived white matter (WM) tract radial and mean diffusivity (DR and MD) were assessed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, and cortical thickness (CTH) was assessed using FreeSurfer. This study investigated changes of WM DR/MD and CTH in subjects with a/e MCI, and associations between these changes and different a/e subfunctions. WMDR/MD underlying rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, caudal anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices was higher for the a/e MCI than the control group, but CTH was not different from controls in any of the regions. WM DR/MD underlying superior frontal, rostral middle frontal, lateral/medial orbitofrontal and retrosplenial cortices were significantly associated with inhibition/switching performance, while caudal middle frontal CTH was significantly associated with attention and divided attention in the patient group. We conclude that increased WMDR/MD in frontal and cingulate regions and cortical thinning in caudal middle frontal region are both associated with executive dysfunction in MCI.

AB Gender differences have been widely reported across a range of cognitive ability tasks, and these differences appear to persist across the lifespan into later adulthood. The current study assessed the influence of gender on the subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in a large cohort (n = 718) of older adult primary care patients. Males (n = 300) were compared to females (n = 418) on the 12 subtests of the RBANS, after controlling for age and education. Significant differences were found on 9 of the subtests. Therefore, gender corrected normative data were calculated, which also control for age and education. Test-retest data were also examined in a subset of this sample (n = 446) that was reevaluated at 1 year. Males and females were comparable on 1-year practice effects. By controlling for additional systematic bias in RBANS scores (e.g., gender effects), these findings allow clinicians and researchers to better match patients and participants when using this screening battery.

AB Previous research has demonstrated sex differences in face processing at both neural and behavioural levels. The present study examined the role of handedness and sexual orientation as mediators of this effect. We compared the performance of LH (left-handed) and RH (right-handed) heterosexual and homosexual male and female participants on a face recognition memory task. Our main findings were that homosexual males have better face recognition memory than both heterosexual males and homosexual women. We also demonstrate better face processing in women than in men. Finally, LH heterosexual participants had better face recognition than LH homosexual participants and also tended to be better than RH heterosexual participants. These findings are consistent with differences in the organisation and laterality of face-processing mechanisms as a function of sex, handedness, and sexual orientation.

AB Objective: The retrieval deficit hypothesis on memory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) implies a selective impairment in recall of learned material with normal encoding, retention, and recognition. This hypothesis has been challenged by new data. We have therefore investigated verbal memory and learning in a large sample of newly diagnosed, drug naive, non-demented patients with PD. Method: From a sample of patients with PD from the Norwegian ParkWest study, 133 PD patients and 133 controls matched on sex, age, and education were included. The California Verbal Learning Test-2 (CVLT-2) was used to assess verbal memory. Results: Patients performed significantly worse than controls on free and cued recall as well as on recognition memory. Patients used the semantic clustering learning strategy significantly less extensively than the controls and the learning slope of the PD patients was significantly less steep. There was no difference in retention when controlling for encoding. Patients did not perform better on the recognition measure or on cued recall (d-prime), as compared to free recall. Executive functions explained a substantial part of the memory deficits. Conclusions: This study suggests that memory impairment in drug naive early PD to a large degree is a deficit of learning/encoding and not of retention or retrieval. An implication is that the retrieval deficit hypothesis should be moderated in its general form. Executive deficits and less extensive use of the efficient semantic clustering learning strategy had a strong impact on learning and memory.

AB Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) often results in demyelination of a network of frontal-subcortical tracts involved in processing emotional information. We investigated the effect of MS on the ability to identify emotional and nonemotional information from static and dynamic stimuli and determined whether difficulties in emotion perception related to quality of life. Method: 32 MS and 33 control participants, matched for age and education, identified emotions and nonemotional information from static images of faces and dynamic videos of people interacting. They also completed cognitive assessment and quality of life ratings. Results: On the static face perception tasks, participants with MS performed more poorly than healthy controls on emotion perception, t(63) = 3.30, p < .01, d = .83, but not identity perception, t(63) = 1.18, d = .30. For the dynamic tasks, the MS group were impaired on emotion perception, t(63) = 3.41, p = .001, d = .86, but not age/gender perception, t(63) = 0.15, d = .04. Ratings of social and psychological aspects of quality of life in MS were related to emotion perception scores controlling for disease severity and duration, age, depression, and cognitive function, with r(2) ranging from .17 to .24. Conclusions: These results indicate a specific deficit in decoding static and dynamic information about emotion in MS, as compared to nonemotional information. There were specific relationships between emotion perception problems and poor social and psychological quality of life, indicating that emotional skills should be considered when evaluating functioning in MS.

AB Background: Most studies reporting cognitive deficits in chronic alcoholics have relied on treatment samples (predominantly men) from inpatient or outpatient treatment facilities. However, the majority of chronic alcoholics have never been in treatment and there is increasing evidence that treated and non-treatment-seeking alcoholic samples come from different populations with regard to alcohol use and other factors related to the severity of disease. Accordingly, in the present study, we assessed a broad range of cognitive functions in 55 treatment-naive alcohol-dependent (TNAD) individuals and 55 nonalcoholic controls (NAC) matched for age and education. In addition, a goal of the present study was to assess potential differential effects of alcohol dependence on cognitive performance in TNAD men and women.
   Methods: Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was conducted on TNAD and NAC. The following 9 performance domains, each consisting of multiple measures, were examined: attention, auditory working memory, verbal processing, abstraction/cognitive flexibility, psychomotor function, immediate memory, delayed memory, reaction time, and spatial processing.
   Results: Analysis revealed no cognitive deficits in TNAD, relative to NAC, in any of the 9 cognitive domains. TNAD performed better than NAC in the attention domain. In addition, while men performed better than women in the spatial domain, there were no TNAD versus NAC group by gender interactions for any domain.
   Conclusions: Our results extend findings that TNAD show minimal behavioral effects of chronic heavy alcohol use and are consistent with the contention that TNAD are relatively cognitively intact. Differences between our findings and those often reported for alcoholics recruited from treatment settings may be understood in terms of differences in alcohol use, along with genetic, psychiatric, and nutritional factors. In addition, the lack of differential effects of alcohol dependence on male and female cognitive performance in our study suggests that TNAD men and women do not differ in the severity of cerebral consequences of alcohol dependence.

AB OBJECTIVE - We explored cognitive impairment in metabolic syndrome in relation to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 819 participants free of clinical stroke and dementia of the population-based Austrain Stroke Prevention Study who had under gone brain MRI neuropsychological testing and a risk factor assessment relevant to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria defined metabolic syndrome High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was also determined
   RESULTS - Of 819 subjects 232 (28 3%) had metabolic syndrome They performed worse than those without metabolic syndrome on cognitive tests assessing memory and executive functioning after adjustment for possible confounders Stratification by sex demonstrated that metabolic syndrome was related to cognitive dysfunction in men but not in women Only in men was an increasing number of metabolic syndrome components associated with worse cognitive performance MRI showed no significant difference in focal ischemic lesions and brain volume between subjects with and without metabolic syndrome and MRI abnormalities failed to explain impaired cognition Cognitive performance was most affected in male subjects with metabolic syndrome who also had high hs-CRP levels
   CONCLUSIONS - Metabolic syndrome exerts detrimental effects on memory and executive functioning in community-dwelling subjects who have not had a clinical stroke or do not have dementia Men are more affected than women particularly if they have high inflammatory markers MRI detected brain abnormalities do not play a crucial role in these relationships

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep-related movement disorder with disturbed sleep and quality of life. RLS patients complain about increased daytime sleepiness, but there are only few and inconsistent reports about cognitive functioning in this group. We compared cognitive performance of 23 unmedicated RLS patients to that of 23 healthy controls matched individually for age, gender, and educational level. Cognitive tasks were chosen to assess short-term attention, working memory, learning and memory, verbal fluency, and executive functioning. RLS patients performed worse than controls in the area of attention and verbal fluency, and performance in these tasks was associated with RLS severity, sleep quality, depression scores, and memory. There was no difference for working memory, memory, learning, cognitive flexibility, and abstract reasoning. We conclude that there is evidence for deficits in short-term attention and verbal fluency in RLS patients. (C) 2010 Movement Disorder Society

TI Childhood cognitive ability: relationship to gestational diabetes

AB Our aim was to test the hypothesis that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in mothers is associated with poorer cognitive ability in their offspring in India.
   During 1997 to 1998 maternal GDM status was assessed by OGTT at 30 +/- 2 weeks of gestation. Between 2007 and 2008, at a mean age of 9.7 years, 515 children (32 offspring of GDM mothers [ODM]; 483 offspring of non-GDM mothers [controls]) from the Mysore Parthenon birth cohort underwent cognitive function assessment using tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition and additional tests measuring learning, long-term storage/retrieval, short-term memory, reasoning, attention and concentration, and visuo-spatial and verbal abilities.
   Compared with controls, ODM scored higher in tests for learning, long-term retrieval/storage (p = 0.008), reasoning (p = 0.02), verbal ability (p = 0.01), and attention and concentration (p = 0.003). In multiple regression, adjusted for the child's age, sex, gestation, neonatal weight and head circumference, maternal age, parity and BMI, and the parent's socioeconomic status, education and rural/urban residence, this difference remained significant only for learning, long-term retrieval/storage (beta = 0.4 SD (95% CI 0.01-0.75); p = 0.04) and verbal ability (beta = 0.5 SD (95% CI 0.09-0.83); p = 0.02), and not with other test scores.
   In this population of healthy Indian children, there was no evidence of lower cognitive ability in ODM. In fact some cognitive scores were higher in ODM.

AB This study aimed to compare the discrimination accuracy of hippocampal volume (HC-Vol), parahippocampal cingulum fractional anisotropy (PHC-FA), hippocampal glucose metabolism (HC-Glu), and any combination of the three measurements among normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three-dimensional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and FDG-PET were applied to age- and gender-matched 17 NC, 17 MCI, and 17 mild AD patients. Subjects also underwent a neuropsychological test battery including three verbal episodic memory tests. Logistic regression analyses were systematically conducted to select the best model for between-group discrimination. PHC-FA plus HC-Vol model, HC-Glu only model, and the model combining all three modalities were finally chosen for NC vs. MCI (discrimination accuracy: 79.4%), MCI vs. AD (73.5%), and NC vs. AD discrimination (94.1%), respectively. All the three imaging measures also showed significant correlation with all three episodic memory tests. These findings support that each imaging measure, respectively, and their combination have a stage-specific potential as a useful neuroimaging marker for detection and progression monitoring of early stage of AD.

AB Background: There is increasing interest in identifying novel cognitive paradigms to help detect preclinical dementia. Promising results have been found in clinical settings using the Semantic Interference Test (SIT), a modification of an existing episodic memory test (Fuld Object Memory Evaluation) that exploits vulnerability to semantic interference in Alzheimer's disease. It is not yet known how broadly this work will generalize to the community at large.
   Methods: Participants aged >= 65 years from the Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) were administered the SIT at study entry. Independent of neuropsychological assessment, participants were rated on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, based on reported loss of cognitively driven everyday functioning. In individuals free of dementia (CDR <1), the concurrent validity of the SIT was assessed by determining its association with CDR using multiple logistic regression models, with CDR 0 (no dementia) vs. 0.5 (possible dementia) as the outcome and the SIT test variables as predictors.
   Results: Poorer performance on all SIT variables but one was associated with higher CDR reflecting possible dementia (Odds Ratios 2.24-4.79). Younger age and female gender also conferred a performance advantage. Years of education and reading ability (a proxy for quality of education) evidenced a very weak association with SIT performance.
   Conclusions: The SIT shows promise as a valid, novel measure to identify early preclinical dementia in a community setting. It has potential utility for assessment of persons who may be illiterate or of low education. Finally, we provide normative SIT data stratified by age which may be utilized by clinicians or researchers in future investigations.

AB Background. Gender is known to modulate the clinical course and severity of bipolar disorder (BD). Although cognitive abnormalities are an established feature of BD, there is limited information regarding whether gender also influences the pattern and severity of cognitive impairment.
   Method. We evaluated the performance of 86 remitted patients with BD, type 1, (BD-I) (36 male and 50 female) and 46 healthy participants (21 male and 25 female) on tasks of general intellectual ability, memory encoding, recognition and retrieval, response inhibition and executive function (abstraction and perseveration). The impact of illness severity in patients was assessed using the global assessment of functioning (GAF).
   Results. We found a gender effect and an interaction between diagnosis and gender on immediate memory, implicating encoding and retrieval processes, both showing male BD-I patients being disadvantaged compared with female patients and healthy controls. Immediate memory correlated with GAF scores and this association was statistically significant for male BD-I patients.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that gender differences in BD-I are associated with memory function, particularly processes relating to encoding and retrieval, and may contribute to poor functional outcome particularly in men.

AB Background: Chronic petrol inhalation can be associated with significant cognitive impairment. While rehabilitation programs can rely on such skills to educate clients and achieve treatment outcomes, cognitive function is rarely assessed on admission. This is particularly true for Indigenous populations where standard assessments are not appropriate. This paper describes a process for assessing cognition in Indigenous Australians. Two studies investigate firstly the demographic factors impacting on cognition for healthy Indigenous Australians and secondly the utility of the assessment process for detecting petrol sniffing related cognitive impairments.
   Methods: Study One assessed a naturalistic sample of healthy Indigenous Australians from the Northern Territory (N = 206; mean age = 28.03) on computerised tests of psychomotor speed, visual attention, memory, learning, spatial awareness and executive functions. Multiple regression analyses determined the unique contributions of six factors (age, education, gender, familiarity with computers, regular long term cannabis use and locality) to the variance in performance for this group. Study Two examined group differences in cognitive performance on the same tests between healthy Indigenous Australians (N = 96) and Indigenous petrol sniffers (N = 50; both age restricted to < 26 years) while controlling those factors found to impact on performance from Study One.
   Results: Age, computer familiarity, and education significantly contributed to the variance in performance measures. While controlling these factors, petrol abuse was associated with poorer performance on complex tasks of psychomotor, visual attention, memory, learning, spatial awareness and executive function.
   Conclusions: This assessment process is useful for detecting substance abuse related impairments in Indigenous Australians and when using this assessment process, age and computer familiarity in particular should be controlled for.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether offspring of parents with exceptional longevity (OPEL) have a lower rate of dementia than offspring of parents with usual survival (OPUS).
   DESIGN: Community-based prospective cohort study.
   SETTING: Bronx, New York.
   PARTICIPANTS: A volunteer sample of 424 community-residing older adults without dementia aged 75 to 85 recruited from Bronx County starting in 1980 and followed for up to 23 years.
   MEASUREMENTS: Epidemiological, clinical, and neuropsychological assessments were completed every 12 to 18 months. OPEL were defined as having at least one parent who reached the age of at least 85. OPUS were those for whom neither parent reached the age of 85. Dementia was diagnosed according to case conference consensus based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, criteria without access to information on parental longevity. Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed using established criteria.
   RESULTS: Of 424 subjects, 149 (35%) were OPEL, and 275 (65%) were OPUS. Mean age at entry for both groups was 79. The OPEL group had a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio50.57, 95% confidence interval = 0.35-0.93). After adjusting for sex, education, race, hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and stroke, results were essentially unchanged. OPEL also had a significantly lower rate of memory decline on the Selective Reminding Test (SRT) than OPUS (P = .03).
   CONCLUSION: OPEL develop dementia and Alzheimer's disease at a significantly lower rate than OPUS. Demographic and medical confounders do not explain this result. Factors associated with longevity may protect against dementia and Alzheimer's disease. J Am Geriatr Soc 58: 1043-1049, 2010.

AB The present study examined the extent to which working (WM) and long-term memory (LTM) reflect the same, related, or completely different constructs and how they relate to other cognitive ability constructs. Participants performed various WM, recall, recognition, general fluid (gF) and general crystallized intelligence (gC) measures. Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the memory measures could be grouped into three separate yet correlated factors (WM, recall, and recognition) and that these factors were strongly related to gF, but were related less so with gC. Furthermore, it was found that the common variance from the three memory factors could be accounted for by a higher-order memory factor which was strongly related to gF, but less so with gC. Finally, structural equation modeling suggested that both the variance common to the WM tasks and the variance common to all the memory tasks accounted for a unique variance in gF.

AB Although considerable research has now shown that the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) and its original companion figure, the Taylor Complex Figure (TCF), are "not" comparable measures of visuospatial learning and memory, recent studies have provided evidence to suggest that the Modified TCF (MTCF) is a comparable measure to the ROCF. The primary aim of the present study was to examine the comparability of ROCF and MTCF accuracy scores with older adults using the traditional incidental learning procedure. A secondary aim was to examine whether performance on the two figures showed comparable gender effects and relationships with age and education. Comparable recall performance, but not copy performance, was found for the two figures in this sample of older adults. No gender differences were found on either figure and similar relationships with age and education were reported for the two figures. These findings are discussed within the context of previous research with consideration given to the clinical implications of the findings and future research recommendations.

AB Although clinical and genetic data for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) support the hypothesis of sexual dimorphism, the neuropsychological findings remain inconclusive The ann of our study was to determine whether there are differences in cognitive performance between men and women with OCD as compared with healthy controls (HCs) A neuropsychological battery was administered to 50 patients with OCD (31 men and 19 women) and 50 HCs matched by sex, age, and educational level with patients We evaluated intelligence, attention, episodic memory, and use of organizational strategies during encoding of verbal and nonverbal information Male patients scored worse than controls did in measures of nonverbal memory tasks, whereas the cognitive performance of women with OCD was consistent with that of their MC counterparts These results suggest a distinct pattern of cognitive dysfunction specific to the patients' sex.

AB This study examined the main and interactive effects of age and sex on relative glucose metabolic rate (rGMR) within gray matter of 39 cortical Brodmann areas (BAs) and the cingulate gyrus using (18)FDG-PET during a verbal memory task in 70 healthy normal adults, aged 20-87 years. Women showed significantly greater age-related rGMR decline in left cingulate gyrus than men (BAs 25, 24, 23, 31, 29). Both groups showed a decline in the anterior cingulate a neuroanatomical structure that mediates effective cognitive-emotional interactions (BAs 32, 24, 25), while the other frontal regions did not show substantial decline. No sex differences in rGMR were identified within temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Sex differences were observed for rGMR within subcomponents of the cingulate gyrus with men higher in BA25 and BA29, but lower in BA24 and BA 23 compared to women. For men, better memory performance was associated with greater rGMR in BA24, whereas in women better performance was associated with orbitofrontal-BA12. These results suggest that both age-related metabolic decline and sex differences within frontal regions are more marked in medial frontal and cingulate areas, consistent with some age-related patterns of affective and cognitive change.

AB item memory and source memory are two integral elements of episodic memory. Although many studies have examined the effect of emotion on item memory, little research has simultaneously taken into account item memory and source memory. In addition, in the majority of previous studies, learning stimuli are used as the source of emotion, making it difficult to understand whether emotion has an effect on encoding or on consolidation of episodic memory. Furthermore, although gender differences exist in neurophysiological responses to emotional stimuli, in many studies gender differences were neglected and this leaves the picture incomplete regarding the effect of emotion on episodic memory. In this study, we examined gender differences in the effects of post-learning emotion on consolidation of item memory and source memory. Participants learned neutral Chinese nouns, took a memory pretest, and were then randomly assigned to three conditions, in which they either watched a 3-min negative video clip, or watched a 3-min positive video clip, or remained calm and relaxed for 3 min. Thirty minutes after the initial learning, participants took a memory posttest. We found that: (1) For females, post-learning negative emotion enhanced consolidation of item memory: however, neither negative emotion nor positive emotion had a significant effect on consolidation of source memory: (2) For males, neither negative nor positive emotion after learning had a significant effect on either item memory or source memory. Possible reasons for the gender differences, as well as the theoretical significance and practical implications of this study were discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate whether, in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), recognition deficits are mainly due to a selective impairment of recollection rather than familiarity. Methods: Nineteen patients with a-MCI and 23 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent two experimental investigations, using the Process Dissociation Procedure (PDP) and the Remember/Know (R/K) procedure, to assess the differential contribution of recollection and familiarity to their recognition performance. Results: Both experimental procedures revealed a selective preservation of familiarity in a-MCI patients. Moreover, the R/K procedure showed a statistically significant impairment of recollection in a-MCI patients for words that were either read or anagrammed during the study phase. Conclusions: A-MCI is known to be commonly associated with a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several previous studies have demonstrated a characteristic impairment of episodic memory in a-MCI, with an early dysfunction of recognition. Our findings are consistent with the knowledge of neurodegeneration occurring in AD, which is characterized, at the earliest disease stages, by a selective involvement of the entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the current study supports the dual process model of recognition, which hypothesizes recollection and familiarity to be independent processes associated with distinct anatomical substrates.

AB We examined the effects of cue types on human spatial memory in 3D virtual environments adapted from classical animal and human tasks. Two classes of cues of different functions were investigated: those that provide directional information, and those that provide positional information. Adding a directional cue (geographical slant) to the spatial delayed-match-to-sample task improved performance in males but not in females. When the slant directional cue was removed in a hidden-target location task, male performance was impaired but female performance was unaffected. The removal of positional cues, on the other hand, impaired female performance but not male performance. These results are consistent with results from laboratory rodents and thus support the hypothesis that sex differences in spatial memory arise from the dissociation between a preferential reliance on directional cues in males and on positional cues in females.

AB Sex differences in humans on virtual water maze navigation are well established when overall performance is measured, e.g., by the total time taken to find the hidden platform, total path length, or quadrant dwell time during probe trials. Currently, it is unknown whether males are better spatial learners than females, or if overall performance differences reflect other aspects of the task unrelated to spatial memory. Here, males and females were tested on a virtual analogue of the Morris water maze. We devised a novel method of analysis in which each trial was divided into an initial trajectory phase and search phase. We also implemented a new measure of spatial learning during early and late training, by including trials in which subjects were only required to indicate where they thought the hidden target zone was located. Consistent with previous reports, males outperformed females on overall measures of task performance. Males also performed significantly better on all initial trajectory phase variables. Interestingly, only small (non-significant) differences were observed during the search phase and when spatial learning was tested without the constraints of a typical water maze trial. Our results suggest that spatial knowledge regarding the location of the hidden target zone is not the main factor responsible for overall sex differences in virtual water maze performance. Instead, the largest sex differences were observed during the initial trajectory phase of the trial, which is thought to depend on effective processing of distal features of the environment.

AB Objectives: Evidence from the literature addressing sex differences in cognition in schizophrenia remains equivocal, with some researchers suggesting that male schizophrenia patients are more impaired than female subjects, while others report no significant sex differences in cognitive functioning. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the differential pattern of cognitive performance observed in healthy men and women is preserved in male and female schizophrenia patients.
   Method: Ninety-six schizophrenia patients (56 men) were compared with 62 age- and gender-ratio matched healthy controls (31 men), on a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed basic cognitive abilities: attention, working memory, abstraction, inhibition, fluency, verbal learning and memory, visual memory, visuospatial skills, and psychomotor speed.
   Results: As a group, schizophrenia patients were significantly impaired in each of the cognitive domains assessed, with the exception of psychomotor speed. The effect of sex was significant for verbal learning and memory, wherein women outperformed men. No significant group x sex interactions were found in any cognitive domains, indicating that the female advantage typically observed in verbal learning and memory remained the same in the schizophrenia patients.
   Conclusion: The degree of cognitive impairment is the same for male and female schizophrenia patients. Those sex differences found among the patients were typical of the healthy population as well. Therefore, differential decrements in basic cognitive domains do not appear to account for the favourable course of schizophrenia in women relative to men.

TI Verbal Fluency in Schizophrenia Does Cognitive Performance Reflect the

AB Verbal fluency is impaired in patients with schizophrenia, but the association with other cognitive domains remains unclear. Forty-seven patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and 47 controls matched by age, gender, years of education, and vocabulary (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III) were assessed in terms of sociodemographic, clinical, and cognitive variables. Healthy controls performed significantly better than patients with schizophrenia in all cognitive measures. However, the way these cognitive domains were related differed across groups. Semantic fluency (SF) and phonological fluency (PF) were predicted by working memory (WM) in patients with schizophrenia, whereas the predictor in the healthy controls was processing speed (PS). Moreover, after dividing the sample of patients according to their performance on fluency tests, we found that a worse performance on SF or PF was predicted by WM. However, for patients with a better performance on fluency, the pattern was similar to that of healthy controls. Cognition may show a different pattern of interaction in schizophrenia, with less impaired patients showing a closer pattern to healthy controls. Therefore, we suggest that, depending on the severity of cognitive deficits, performance on neuropsychological tests may not reflect the same underlying mechanisms.

AB The potential of putative cognitive-enhancing compounds to improve mental processing both in healthy and vulnerable populations is an area of growing interest to scientific and clinical communities. The possible influence of individual genetic differences on efficacy of these compounds has yet to be considered. We sought to investigate the profile of young-adult apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 carriers across cognitive domains given that possession of this gene variant increases risk of developing dementia in later life. We also explored whether APOE genotype interacts with the cognitive enhancer, nicotine. A total of 1 mg of the cholinergic agonist nicotine was administered through nasal spray to healthy non-smoking young adults (aged 18-30) with either epsilon 3/epsilon 3 (N = 29) or epsilon 4 (at least one epsilon 4 allele, N = 27) genotype. Participants were matched on age, sex, and IQ in a placebo-controlled, double-blind 2 (drug: placebo, nicotine) x 2 (genotype: epsilon 4, epsilon 4) between subjects design. Here, we show that, paradoxically, possession of the epsilon 4 allele confers a cognitive advantage on tasks mediated by the frontal lobe, and that young carriers of the epsilon 4 allele show larger cognitive benefit from procholinergic nicotinic stimulation. These results are the first to show that genetic differences influence the efficacy of a cognitive enhancer.

DE amygdala; recognition memory; sex differences; unpleasant arousal
AB Despite a well-established relationship between amygdala activation during learning and long-term memory, contributions of amygdala to immediate memory have not been studied to date. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5-T field strength to determine whether amygdala responses to emotional pictures would predict performance on an immediate recognition memory test. Sex differences in amygdala activation were related to false-positive error rates in recognizing unpleasant pictures. Specifically, increased right amygdala activation during unpleasant picture viewing was related to lower false-positive rates for men and higher false-positive rates for women. Our results indicate that increased amygdala activation while viewing unpleasant pictures may preferentially facilitate immediate recognition memory in men relative to women.

AB Objective: Gender differences exist in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD), therefore the aim of the present study was to clarify the role of gender in cognitive deficits in these disorders.
   Methods: Cognitive performance was examined in schizophrenia (24M : 14F) and BD (16M : 24F) patients compared with age-, IQ- and gender-matched control participants (21M : 22F). The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used to assess five cognitive domains: immediate memory/learning, visuospatial ability, language, attention, and delayed memory, which are summed to provide a Total score.
   Results: In comparison to controls, schizophrenia patients showed deficits on all domains, while BD patients had impaired immediate memory/learning, language and Total score. Schizophrenia patients showed deficits compared to BD in the Total score, immediate and delayed memory and visuospatial ability. The Total and domain scores were not different in men and women across or within groups. There were gender effects on four of the 12 individual cognitive tasks, in which female patients outperformed male patients. Further, there were gender differences across groups for three of the individual tasks: female schizophrenia patients showed poorer story memory and story recall compared to male schizophrenia patients; female BD patients had enhanced figure copy performance compared to male BD patients.
   Conclusions: The RBANS highlighted the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and BD patients compared to controls and also each other. There were no overall gender differences in cognition.

AB Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) and female sex are risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear whether apoE4 contributes to behavioral function at younger ages. Standard neuropsychological assessments [intelligence quotient (IQ), attention, and executive function] and a test developed in this laboratory (Memory Island test of spatial learning and memory) were used to determine whether E4 and sex affect neuropsychological performance in healthy primary school children (age 7-10). A medical history was also obtained from the mother to determine whether negative birth outcomes were associated with apoE4. Mothers of apoE4+ children were more likely to report that their newborn was placed in an intensive care unit. A sex difference in birth weight was noted among apoE4- (males > females), but not apoE4+, offspring. Conversely, among apoE4+, but not apoE4- children, there was a sex difference in the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) vocabulary score favoring boys. ApoE4- girls had better visual recall than apoE4+ girls or apoE4- boys on the Family Pictures test. Finally, apoE4+, unlike apoE4-, children did not show spatial memory retention during the Memory Island probe trial. Thus, apoE4 may affect neurobehavioral performance, particularly spatial memory, and antenatal health decades before any clinical expression of neurodegenerative processes.

AB Neuropsychological research suggests that recognition memory (RM) and recall memory are impaired in patients with a major depressive disorder or a dysphoric mood state. This study examines the proposal that abnormalities in recollection (a form of recall) result from a breakdown in frontal strategic memory processes involved in encoding and retrieval, and executive functions linked to reality monitoring, planning, problem-solving, reasoning and decision-making. We investigated two predictions arising from this theory. Firstly, patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder (MDD) will display a dissociation between (deficient) recollection and (preserved) familiarity. Secondly. if recollection impairments are indicative of a breakdown in prefrontal strategic memory processes which are dependent, at least in part, on executive processes, then an explicit correlational approach predicts that recollection will be positively associated with the severity of executive dysfunction in MDD patients. The remember/know paradigm was used to investigate RM for words and neutral faces in 16 MDD patients and 16 healthy volunteers, matched for age, gender and estimates of premorbid IQ. Measures of executive function included working memory, reasoning and decision-making. Applying the Dual Process Signal Detection interpretation of the remember/know data, the MDD group displayed significant impairments in RM and recollection rates for both verbal and neutral facial memoranda. In contrast, familiarity-aware rates were preserved. There was no evidence of executive dysfunction in the patient group, and little evidence that recollection rates correlated with executive function. Furthermore, a single process signal detection approach suggested that the MDD patients displayed a reduction in sensitivity for RM and remember rates but not know responses. The criteria for detecting studied from unstudied items, and remembering from knowing, were the same in both patient and healthy control groups. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the view that MDD is marked by a decline in RM, which is underpinned by an impairment in recollection rather than familiarity processes. The extent to which the recollection deficiencies arise from disruption of strategic memory and executive processes requires further investigation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB MUSICIANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DEMONSTRATE significantly better verbal memory abilities than do nonmusicians. In this study, we examined whether forms of music engagement other than formal music training might also predict verbal memory performance. Gender, socioeconomic status, and music performance variables were controlled in the main study; IQ was also assessed for a subset of participants. While performance musicianship remained a stronger predictor of verbal learning and memory, convincing evidence is presented that nonperformance music engagement (listening activity) also predicted verbal memory measures. The role of music engagement was independent of control factors both in the main study results and in the subset. The findings highlight the need for a more extensive conceptualization of musicianship in research that examines the impact of music on cognitive performance.

AB The first objective of this work was to compare scores obtained in the daily memory function between young and elderly people, and to check whether there are differences between the groups for each of the profile scores obtained in the memory test. A second aim of this paper is to study the relationship between everyday memory and age, while controlling for gender and educational level. The total and profile scores obtained in the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test were compared in a sample of 60 young and 120 elderly people from Valencia (Spain). Results showed significant differences between the two groups: those between 18 and 30 years obtained a higher average than those over 65. Once the group comparison was controlled for gender and educational level, the statistical effect of age group disappeared. The non-significant effect of group can not be explained by the introduction of gender, because both its main effect and the interaction were not statistically significant. However, educational level had a statistically significant effect which may explain the non-significant effect of group in this new analysis. The main conclusion is the need to carefully control for educational level in all studies related with everyday memory and ageing, as the differences found could be due to generational differences more than to biological deterioration.

AB Norms on seven composite scores derived from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) are reported here. These scores reflect a variety of verbal memory processes: learning, interference, retention over time, and retrieval efficiency. The norms are based on 943 children ranging in age from 8 to 17 years, divided into 10 age cohorts, and 528 adults, ranging in age from 21 to 91 years, divided into 6 age cohorts. Overall, the learning measures were the most sensitive to age. The most significant changes in memory as measured with these composite scores took place in the very young and very old age groups. These changes may be attributable to frontal lobe maturation in youth and deterioration in old age. Female participants show superiority over male participants on various verbal memory measures. These norms on the composite scores are primarily expected to serve the clinician in the process of memory assessment by supplementing the existing norms on individual trials of the Rey AVLT.

AB Despite several studies investigating the impact of sex and violence in television on consumer behavior and memory for products in commercials, results remain inconsistent and debated. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of television violence and sex on memory for commercials and willingness to buy products. Two hundred twelve young adults were assigned to watch either a sexual, violent, combined sexual and violent or neutral television show. Within each show were embedded 12 commercials, four violent, four sexual, and four neutral. Results indicated that violent or sexual content of the television show did not impair memory for commercials or willingness to buy products, and that sexual or violent content in the commercials themselves increased memory for those commercials. Implications for the current study are that violent or sexual shows may adequately function in attracting viewers' attention, with sexual and violent content in the commercials themselves improving viewers memory for products. Use of violent or sexual content in commercials may thus be useful in advertising for brand recall.

AB To unveil the brain metabolic correlates of (un)awareness of memory deficit in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), forty-two outpatients underwent brain F-18-FDG-PET. Awareness of memory deficit was assessed with the Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), identifying two groups: low (MCI/unaware; 17 patients) and good (MCI/aware; 25 patients) aMCI awareness. Twenty-nine age-matched healthy subjects represented the control group. SPM2 was used to assess the correlation between brain metabolism and MAC-Q score, for comparisons between each patient group and controls, and between aMCI/unaware and aMCI/aware groups. The two aMCI groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, education, depression, and neuropsychological tests scores. In the whole 42-patient group, a positive correlation was found between MAC-Q score and metabolism in posterior cingulate cortex in both hemispheres and in inferior parietal lobule, middle cingulate cortex, precuneus and angular gyrus in the left hemisphere. Compared to controls, hypometabolism was found in aMCI/unaware in three large clusters, including precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and superior occipital gyrus, in the left hemisphere, and in inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. Smaller clusters of hypometabolism were found in bilateral temporal lobe in aMCI/aware. Hypometabolism in inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere was highlighted in aMCI/unaware versus aMCI/aware. The significant correlation in all 42 aMCI patients points to posteromedial cortex as a key node of the network being involved in awareness of memory deficit. Patients with low awareness show a more severe hypometabolic pattern, typical of Alzheimer's disease and therefore could be more at risk of developing dementia.

AB The cognitive status of aged familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients treated with long-term statin therapy was compared with that of population controls. A comprehensive cohort of 43 elderly (age >= 65 years) patients all with the same FH North Karelia mutation living in North Karelia (eastern Finland) was identified, 37 of whom (aged 65 to 84 years) agreed to participate. All but one of these FH patients had been using statins for approximately 15 years. Population-based controls (aged 65 to 84 years, n = 309) were the participants of the Health 2000 Survey living in eastern Finland. The cognitive assessment was conducted with tests for verbal fluency, Word List Learning (WLL) and Word List Delayed Recall (WLDR) subtests in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease test battery. After adjustment for age, gender, education, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease, FH patients were more likely to be in the top tertile of the WLDR (Odds ratio (OR) 3.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-7.63) and WLL3 (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.28-6.25) subtests. When the FH patients were subdivided according to the median length of their statin therapy, the ORs to be in the top tertile in the WLDR subtest were 1.65 (95% CI 0.52-5.25) for those with less and 5.40 (95% CI 1.74-17.72) in those individuals with more than median length of statin therapy. In conclusion, aged FH patients receiving long-term statin therapy exhibited better episodic memory than population controls, and this association became even more pronounced with longer statin therapy.

AB We present the first large-scale comparison of prospective memory (PM) and retrospective memory (RM) from 8 to 50 years of age (N = 318,614). Participants in an Internet study were asked to remember to click on a smiley face (single-trial event-based PM test) and to indicate whether/where a picture had changed from study to test (single-trial RM test), in both cases after retention intervals filled with working-memory tests and questionnaires. Both PM and RM improved during childhood; however, whereas maximal PM was reached by teenagers, with approximately linear decline through the 20s-40s, RM continued to improve through the 20s and 30s. On both tests, females outperformed males and achieved maximal success at earlier ages. Strikingly, 10-11-year-old girls performed significantly better than females in their late 20s on the PM test. The presence of the smiley face at encoding and temporal uncertainty (expecting it olatero rather than at the oendo of the test) both benefited PM; these effects decreased and increased, respectively, from childhood to middle age. The findings demonstrate that in a cross-sectional study (a) developmental trajectories are qualitatively different between PM and RM, and (b) the relative influence of PM cues differs between younger and older ages.

AB Context The herbal product Ginkgo biloba is taken frequently with the intention of improving cognitive health in aging. However, evidence from adequately powered clinical trials is lacking regarding its effect on long-term cognitive functioning.
   Objective To determine whether G biloba slows the rates of global or domain-specific cognitive decline in older adults.
   Design, Setting, and Participants The Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory ( GEM) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 3069 community-dwelling participants aged 72 to 96 years, conducted in 6 academic medical centers in the United States between 2000 and 2008, with a median follow-up of 6.1 years.
   Intervention Twice-daily dose of 120-mg extract of G biloba (n=1545) or identical-appearing placebo (n=1524).
   Main Outcome Measures Rates of change over time in the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE), in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), and in neuropsychological domains of memory, attention, visual-spatial construction, language, and executive functions, based on sums of z scores of individual tests.
   Results Annual rates of decline in z scores did not differ between G biloba and placebo groups in any domains, including memory (0.043; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.034-0.051 vs 0.041; 95% CI, 0.032-0.050), attention ( 0.043; 95% CI, 0.037-0.050 vs 0.048; 95% CI, 0.041-0.054), visuospatial abilities (0.107; 95% CI, 0.097-0.117 vs 0.118; 95% CI, 0.108-0.128), language (0.045; 95% CI, 0.037-0.054 vs 0.041; 95% CI, 0.033-0.048), and executive functions (0.092; 95% CI, 0.086-0.099 vs 0.089; 95% CI, 0.082-0.096). For the 3MSE and ADAS-Cog, rates of change varied by baseline cognitive status ( mild cognitive impairment), but there were no differences in rates of change between treatment groups ( for 3MSE, P=.71; for ADAS-Cog, P=.97). There was no significant effect modification of treatment on rate of decline by age, sex, race, education, APOE*E4 allele, or baseline mild cognitive impairment (P>.05).
   Conclusion Compared with placebo, the use of G biloba, 120 mg twice daily, did not result in less cognitive decline in older adults with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment.

AB Background: The aim of the study was to explore the processes underlying schizophrenia patients' reflections on their own memory. Cognitive deficits and insight problems are considered core symptoms of schizophrenia. Even when people fail to recall a solicited target, they can provide feeling of knowing (FOK) judgments that reflect their ability to judge the accessibility of the target in memory. The metamemory approach allows for direct and experimental quantification of the correspondence between the subjective judgments and the objective measures of memory performance. According to the accessibility hypothesis, FOK evaluations rely on the accessibility of partial and/or contextual information relevant to the memory target.
   Methods: The accessibility of partial information relating to a memory target was investigated in 21 patients and 21 healthy comparison subjects matched for age, gender, and level of education. The material to be learned consisted of four-letter nonsense tetragrams, with each letter providing partial information about the four-letter target.
   Results: The results show that despite memory recall (p<.01) and recognition impairments (p=.02) and lower FOK ratings (p<.05), patients' metamemory judgments increased linearly with the amount of partial information recalled (from one letter to four letters, p<.01). The products of memory retrieval were predictive of both their FOK judgments and their subsequent memory performance.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients are as capable as comparison subjects of relying on the products of memory retrieval to monitor accurately their awareness of what they do or do not know. The finding may be of interest for cognitive remediation.

AB This experiment concerned the effects of emotional content, self-relevance, and emotional tone of testimony on memory. Eyewitness accounts of 4 events were constructed that systematically differed in emotionality and self-relevance. The testimony, captured on videotape, was expressed with or without negative emotion. After viewing one of the videotaped accounts, participants were administered cued-recall and recognition memory tests. Significant main effects indicated that participants best remembered testimony that was emotional in content, self-relevant, and negatively expressed. Although emotional content and self-relevance interacted to affect state anxiety, the latter did not mediate memory effects. Overall, significant gender differences in state anxiety but not memory emerged. Implications for understanding the influence of emotion on juror memory are discussed.

AB In 2 studies, children ages 3 to 7 years were asked to recall a series of touches that occurred during a previous staged event. The recall interview took place I week after the event in Study I and immediately after the event in Study 2. Each recall interview had 2 sections: In I section, children were given human figure drawings (HFDs) and were asked to show where the touching took place; in the other section, the same questions were asked without the HFDs (verbal condition). Children were randomly assigned to 2 different conditions: HFD 1st/verbal 2nd or verbal 1st/HFD 2nd. There were 2 major findings. First, HFDs elicited more errors than the verbal condition when used to probe for information that the child had already been asked. Second, regardless of interview method, children had poor recall of the touches even when these Occurred Minutes before the interview. It is suggested that cognitive mechanisms involving memory and semantics underlie children's poor recall of touching in both verbal and HFD conditions.

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a regulatory role in neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity and has been linked to glucose regulation and cognition. Associations among plasma BDNF, cognition, and insulin function were explored. Forty-one participants with impaired insulin function (IIF), ranging from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), were matched with 41 healthy controls on gender, age, education, and IQ. Participants received complete medical, neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological evaluations. IIF individuals had significantly lower plasma BDNF levels than controls, particularly females, and higher BDNF levels were associated with poorer explicit memory in IIF females, suggesting that higher levels within this group may reflect the body's efforts to respond to damage. After accounting for age, education, and HbA1c, BDNF significantly predicted 13.1-23.5% of the variance in explicit memory in IIF women. These findings suggest that BDNF elevations within diseased groups may not always be a marker of health. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To examine the impact of subjective depressive symptoms on objective performance on tests of several cognitive domains, in a community-based sample of older adults.
   Methods An age-stratified sample of 2036 individuals aged 65+ years was drawn from the electoral rolls of a U.S. community, excluding individuals with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. A cognitive test battery and a modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (mCES-D) were completed by 1982 participants. Cognitive test scores were compared across levels of depressive symptoms, and composite scores created to represent cognitive domains of attention, language, memory, visuospatial, and executive function. Multivariable regression models tested the association of depressive symptoms with cognitive domain composite scores, adjusting for age, sex, race, and education.
   Results Most participants reported no depressive symptoms. Small differences in cognitive scores were observed on all tests among those with 0, 1-2, and >= 3 symptoms. Adjusting for demographic variables, depressive symptoms remained associated with lower performance on all cognitive composites except attention, most strongly with executive function. Depressive symptoms explained <2% of the variance in test scores, less than that explained by age or education.
   Conclusion In this population-based sample of older adults, restricted to those with normal or only mildly impaired cognition, a relatively small proportion reported any depressive symptoms. The number of depressive symptoms had strong statistically significant associations with performance in most cognitive domains. However, depressive symptoms explained little of the variance in cognitive performance, with relatively small differences in scores among those with and without symptoms.

AB This study evaluated associations between pre-deployment neurocognitive performance and post-deployment posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a sample of deployed active duty Army soldiers. As part of a larger longitudinal study, each participant completed baseline measures of memory, executive attention, and response inhibition, and baseline and post-deployment self-report measures of PTSD symptom severity. Data were subjected to multiple regression analyses that examined associations between baseline neurocognitive performances and longitudinal PTSD symptom outcome. Results revealed that pre-trauma immediate recall Of Visual information was associated with post-deployment PTSD symptom severity, even after controlling for pre-deployment PTSD symptom levels, combat intensity, age, gender, and test-retest interval. There was also an interaction between pre-deployment PTSD symptom severity and pre-deployment immediate visual recall and Verbal learning, indicating that neurocognitive performances were more strongly (and negatively) associated with residualized post-deployment PTSD symptoms at higher levels of pre-deployment PTSD symptoms. These findings highlight the potential role of pre-trauma neurocognitive functioning in moderating the effects of trauma exposure on PTSD symptoms. (JINS, 2009 15, 840-852.)

AB The aim of this study wits to examine discrepancies between immediate/delayed recall and recall/working memory in middle-aged and older persons by age and education. Participants were 322 healthy individuals from the community who were stratified into three age and three education groups. Immediate and delayed recall distributions of WMS-III Logical Memory (LM) scores approximated normal curves. and LM savings scores showed a significant, but small, effect of age. LM (immediate, delayed) and Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) discrepancies varied as a function of age and education. The difference between LM and LNS was not significant in the younger and less educated participants, but increased with a-e in the most educated group, and in the oldest group LNS exceeded LM (immediate and delayed). The results indicate deterioration in encoding and retrieval, rather than storage, with age, and show a differential, but small, effect of age and education on the memory measures. Working memory was resistant to age-related decline relative to immediate and delayed recall in the oldest, most educated group. Delayed recall-working memory discrepancy is relatively stable with age and education and may be a useful index of the onset of memory pathology across different ages and levels of education.

AB Objectives To assess the prevalence of alcoholism in elderly living in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and investigate associated risk factors.
   Methods A total of 1,563 individuals aged 60 years or older, of both genders of three districts of different socioeconomic classes (high, medium and low) in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil) were interviewed. The CAGE screening test for alcoholism was applied and a structured interview was used to assess associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. The tests Mini Mental State Examination, Fuld Object Memory Evaluation, The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and Bayer-Activities of Daily Living Scale were used for cognitive and functional assessment.
   Results Prevalence of alcoholism was 9.1%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that alcoholism was associated with male gender, 'mulatto' ethnicity, smoking, and cognitive and functional impairment. In addition, the younger the individual and the lower the schooling level, the higher the risk for alcoholism.
   Conclusions The results obtained in this study show that alcoholism is highly frequent in the community-dwelling elderly living in Sao Paulo, and that it is associated with socio-demographic and clinical risk factors similar to those reported in the literature. This suggests that alcoholism in the elderly of a developing country shares the same basic characteristics seen in developed countries. These findings suggest that it is essential for health services and professional to be prepared to meet this demand that will significantly grow in the next years, especially in developing countries, where the rates of population aging are higher than those of developed countries.

AB Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown structural abnormalities of the cingulum bundle (CB) in patients with schizophrenia. However, regional specificity and functional relevance of the pregenual and dorsal CB subdivisions has not been fully studied. In the current study, 31 patients with schizophrenia and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects underwent DTI to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in cross sections of dorsal and pregenual CB tractography. To test the hypothesis of region-specific association with neurocognition, all of the patients and 31 controls performed the Stroop task, which is assumed to mainly involve dorsal cingulate function. The verbal memory subscale of Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and premorbid IQs estimated from the Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test, which were non-specific to dorsal cingulate function, were also employed as control neurocognitive indices. Significant bilateral FA reductions in the pregenual and dorsal CB, and bilateral MD increases in the dorsal CB were observed in the patients compared with the controls. As predicted, significant associations between DTI measures and neurocognition were found in the schizophrenia group only: double-dissociable correlation between higher MD in the dorsal, not in the pregenual CB, and a longer reaction time in the Stroop task, not verbal memory or premorbid IQs. The current DTI study suggests that structural disruption of the dorsal CB has region-specific functional relevance to selective attention deficits, although structural disruption also exists in the pregenual CB in patients with schizophrenia.

AB Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of vascular risk factors which has been related to dementia and cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to describe the neuropsychological profile of metabolic syndrome patients. An extensive neuropsychological protocol was administered to 55 patients and 35 controls assessing memory, executive, visuoperceptual and visuoconstructive functions, language and speed of processing. There were differences between groups in speed of processing and some executive functions after controlling for the influences of education and gender. The results suggest that metabolic syndrome may be a prodromal state of vascular cognitive impairment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: 1) To report site-specific normative values by age, sex and educational level for four components of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group cognitive test battery; 2) to estimate the main and interactive effects of age, sex, and educational level by site; and 3) to investigate the effect of site by region and by rural or urban location.
   Methods: Population-based cross-sectional one phase catchment area surveys were conducted in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, China and India. The protocol included the administration of the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI 'D', generating the COGSCORE measure of global function), and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) verbal fluency (VF), word list memory (WLM, immediate recall) and recall (WLR, delayed recall) tests. Only those free of dementia were included in the analysis.
   Results: Older people, and those with less education performed worse on all four tests. The effect of sex was much smaller and less consistent. There was a considerable effect of site after accounting for compositional differences in age, education and sex. Much of this was accounted for by the effect of region with Chinese participants performing better, and Indian participants worse, than those from Latin America. The effect of region was more prominent for VF and WLM than for COGSCORE and WLR.
   Conclusion: Cognitive assessment is a basic element for dementia diagnosis. Age- and education-specific norms are required for this purpose, while the effect of gender can probably be ignored. The basis of cultural effects is poorly understood, but our findings serve to emphasise that normative data may not be safely generalised from one population to another with quite different characteristics. The minimal effects of region on COGSCORE and WLR are reassuring with respect to the cross-cultural validity of the 10/66 dementia diagnosis, which uses only these elements of the 10/66 battery.

AB The authors examined associations of health behaviors over a 17-year period, separately and in combination, with cognition in late midlife in 5,123 men and women from the Whitehall II study (United Kingdom). Health behaviors were assessed in early midlife (mean age 44 years; phase 1, 1985-1988), in midlife (mean age 56 years; phase 5, 1997-1999), and in late midlife (mean age 61 years; phase 7, 2002-2004). A score of the number of unhealthy behaviors (smoking, alcohol abstinence, low physical activity, and low fruit and vegetable consumption) was defined as ranging from 0 to 4. Poor (defined as scores in the worst sex-specific quintile) executive function and memory in late midlife (phase 7) were analyzed as outcomes. Compared with those with no unhealthy behaviors, those with 3-4 unhealthy behaviors at phase 1 (odds ratio (OR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 2.65), phase 5 (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.76, 3.22), and phase 7 (OR 2.76, 95% CI: 2.04, 3.73) were more likely to have poor executive function. A similar association was observed for memory. The odds of poor executive function and memory were the greater the more times the participant reported unhealthy behaviors over the 3 phases. This study suggests that both the number of unhealthy behaviors and their duration are associated with subsequent cognitive function in later life.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the separate effects of myelomeningocele (MMC) and hydrocephalus on intelligence and neuropsychological functions in a population-based series of children.
   Of the 69 children with MMC born in 1992-1999 in western Sweden, nine did not develop hydrocephalus. Eight of them participated in this study and were compared with age- and gender-matched children with MMC in combination with hydrocephalus and with controls.
   Children with only MMC had an IQ of 103 compared with 75 in those with hydrocephalus added to the MMC and they had significantly better immediate and long-term memory and executive functions. When compared with controls, they had difficulty with learning and executive functions, but when the two children with an IQ of < 70 were excluded, those with only MMC performed just as well as the controls.
   Hydrocephalus rather than MMC in itself appeared to cause the cognitive deficits found in children with MMC.

AB Background: The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) flagship study of aging aimed to recruit 1000 individuals aged over 60 to assist with prospective research into Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper describes the recruitment of the cohort and gives information about the study methodology, baseline demography, diagnoses, medical comorbidities, medication use, and cognitive function of the participants.
   Methods: Volunteers underwent a screening interview, had comprehensive cognitive testing, gave 80 ml of blood, and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. One quarter of the sample also underwent amyloid PET brain imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB PET) and MRI brain imaging, and a subgroup of 10% had ActiGraph activity monitoring and body composition scanning.
   Results: A total of 1166 volunteers were recruited, 54 of whom were excluded from further study due to comorbid disorders which could affect cognition or because of withdrawal of consent. Participants with AD (211) had neuropsychological profiles which were consistent with AD, and were more impaired than participants with mild cognitive impairment (133) or healthy controls (768), who performed within expected norms for age on neuropsychological testing. PiB PET scans were performed on 287 participants, 100 had DEXA scans and 91 participated in ActiGraph monitoring.
   Conclusion: The participants comprising the AIBL cohort represent a group of highly motivated and well-characterized individuals who represent a unique resource for the study of AD. They will be reassessed at 18-month intervals in order to determine the predictive utility of various biomarkers, cognitive parameters and lifestyle factors as indicators of AD, and as predictors of future cognitive decline.

AB Background: Trials in developing countries suggest that improving young children's diet may benefit cognitive development. Whether dietary composition influences young children's cognition in developed countries is unclear. Although many studies have examined the relation between type of milk received in infancy and subsequent cognition, there has been no investigation of the possible effect of variations in the weaning diet. Methods: We studied 241 children aged 4 years, whose diet had been assessed at age 6 and 12 months. We measured IQ with the Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scale of Intelligence, visual attention, visuomotor precision, sentence repetition and verbal fluency with the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY), and visual form-constancy with the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills. Results: In sex-adjusted analyses, children whose diet in infancy was characterised by high consumption of fruit, vegetables and home-prepared foods ('infant guidelines' dietary pattern) had higher full-scale and verbal IQ and better memory performance at age 4 years. Further adjustment for maternal education, intelligence, social class, quality of the home environment and other potential confounding factors attenuated these associations but the relations between higher 'infant guidelines' diet score and full-scale and verbal IQ remained significant. For a standard deviation increase in 'infant guidelines' diet score at 6 or 12 months full-scale IQ rose by .18 (95% CI .04 to .31) of a standard deviation. For a standard deviation increase in 'infant guidelines' diet score at 6 months verbal IQ rose by .14 (.01 to.27) of a standard deviation. There were no associations between dietary patterns in infancy and 4-year performance on the other tests. Conclusions: These findings suggest that dietary patterns in early life may have some effect on cognitive development. It is also possible that they reflect the influence of unmeasured confounding factors.

ID SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; RECOGNITION MEMORY; AWAKE STATE; CONSOLIDATION;

AB To investigate gender difference in the effects of daytime sleep on item and source memories, which are dissociable elements of declarative memory, and the effects of sleep on recollection and familiarity, which are two processes underlying recognition.
   Participants saw a series of pictures with either blue or red background, and were then given a pretest for item and source memories. Then males and females respectively were randomly assigned either to a wake or a sleep condition. In the wake condition, participants remained awake until the posttest; in the sleep condition, participants slept for 1 h until awakened and asked to remain awake until the posttest.
   Daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. For females, however, neither recollection nor familiarity appeared to be influenced by daytime sleep.
   The mechanism underlying gender difference may be linked with different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different electrophysiological changes during daytime sleep.

AB This paper describes the methods and sample characteristics of a series of Spanish normative studies (The NEURONORMA project). The primary objective of our research was to collect normative and psychometric information on a sample of people aged over 49 years. The normative information was based on a series of selected, but commonly used, neuropsychological tests covering attention, language, visuo-perceptual abilities, constructional tasks, memory, and executive functions. A sample of 356 community dwelling individuals was studied. Demographics, socio-cultural, and medical data were collected. Cognitive normality was validated via informants and a cognitive screening test. Norms were calculated for midpoint age groups. Effects of age, education, and sex were determined. The use of these norms should improve neuropsychological diagnostic accuracy in older Spanish subjects. These data may also be of considerable use for comparisons with other normative studies. Limitations of these normative data are also commented on.

AB The second to fourth (2D:4D) digit ratio, a sexually dimorphic, phenotypic characteristic putatively associated with perinatal androgen action, has been used to evaluate the hypothesized relation between prenatal hormonal factors and a variety of sexually dimorphic behaviors, including sex-linked psychopathology. Smaller digit ratios, suggestive of stronger perinatal androgen action, have been associated with male-linked disorders (e.g., autism), and larger digit ratios, suggestive of weaker perinatal androgen action, have been associated with female-linked disorders (e.g., depression and eating disorders). To evaluate the possible relation between digit ratio and another traditionally female-linked disorder, anxiety, 2D:4D ratios were measured in a non-clinical sample (58 men, 52 women). Participants also completed a battery of anxiety and gender role measures and performed two spatial/cognitive tasks typically showing a male advantage (mental rotation and targeting) and two tasks typically showing a female advantage (location memory and spatial working memory). Men with a more feminine pattern of sex-linked traits and behaviors (including digit ratios) reported greater anxiety. In contrast, greater anxiety in women was associated with both female-typical and male-typical traits and behaviors, but and no significant association between digit ratio and anxiety was found. This pattern of results suggests that the development of anxiety is multiply determined, with contributing factors varying by sex.

AB This paper reports a study of how familiarity and gender may influence the frames of reference used in memory to represent a real-world regularly shaped environment. Familiar and unfamiliar participants learned the locations of three triads of buildings by walking on a path which encircled each triad. Then they were shown with maps reproducing these triads at five different orientations (from 0 degrees to 180 degrees) and had to judge whether each triad represented correctly the relative positions between the buildings. Results showed that unfamiliar participants performed better when the orientation of triads was closer to the learning perspective (0 degrees and 45 degrees) and corresponded to front rather than to back positions. Instead, familiar participants showed a facilitation for triads oriented along orthogonal axes (0 degrees-180 degrees, 90 degrees) and no difference between front and back positions. These findings suggested that locations of unfamiliar buildings were mentally represented in terms of egocentric frames of reference; instead, allocentric frames of reference defined by the environment were used when the environment was familiar. Finally, males were more accurate and faster than females. and this difference was particularly evident in participants unfamiliar with the environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB object location memory has been considered the only spatial ability in which females display an advantage over males. We examined sex differences in long-term object location memory. After participants studied an array of objects, they were asked to recall the locations of these objects three minutes later or one week later. Results showed a female advantage only in the three-minute memory task. Additionally. we analyzed sex differences in the ability to recognize both location-exchanged and location-maintained objects. Females were superior to males at recognizing location-exchanged objects after three minutes, but not after one week. Although the one-week group's memory performance for location-exchanged objects was marginally lower. some members of that group recognized the location-maintained objects at higher levels of performance. Therefore, we concluded that the female advantage in object location memory is limited to immediate detection of changes. The relevant evolutionary theories are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

ID ADVANTAGE; RETENTION; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS
AB Recent studies suggest that human memory systems are "tuned" to remember information that is processed in terms of its fitness value. When people are asked to rate the relevance of words to a survival scenario, performance on subsequent surprise memory tests exceeds that obtained after most other known encoding techniques. The present experiments explored this effect using survival scenarios designed to mimic the division of labor thought to characterize early hunter-gatherer societies. It has been suggested that males and females have different cognitive specializations due to the unique survival tasks (hunting and gathering, respectively) they typically performed during periods of human evolution; the present experiments tested whether such specializations might be apparent in memory for words rated for relevance to these activities. Males and females were asked to rate the relevance of random words to prototypical hunting and gathering scenarios or to matched, non-fitness-relevant control scenarios (gathering food on a scavenger hunt or in a hunting contest). Surprise retention tests revealed superior memory for the words when they were rated for relevance to hunting and gathering scenarios, compared with when they were rated for relevance to the control scenarios, but no sex differences were found in memory performance.

AB Do females remember their surroundings better than males? Does it matter who or what is in those surroundings? In small groups, 108 undergraduates from a Midwestern university in the USA were instructed to pay attention to a videotaped person (target) while seated in an office with an experimenter (non-target). Afterwards, in a surprise recall task, participants' memory for the appearance of the target, non-target, and office was tested. Females' greater interpersonal orientation was predicted to give them an advantage over males in memory for only the people. Results showed that females had better memory for the target and non-target but not the office. Discussion centers on the importance of people versus objects in explaining females' greater appearance accuracy.

   ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; WORDS; FORM
AB Background: Some studies, most of them case-reports, suggest that synesthetes have an advantage in visual search and episodic memory tasks. The goal of this study was to examine this hypothesis in a group study.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we tested thirteen grapheme-color synesthetes and we compared their performance on a visual search task and a memory test to an age-, handedness-, education-, and gender-matched control group. The results showed no significant group differences (all relevant ps>.50). For the visual search task effect sizes indicated a small advantage for synesthetes (Cohen's d between .19 and .32). No such advantage was found for episodic memory (Cohen's d,. 05).
   Conclusions/Significance: The results indicate that synesthesia per se does not seem to lead to a strong performance advantage. Rather, the superior performance of synesthetes observed in some case-report studies may be due to individual differences, to a selection bias or to a strategic use of synesthesia as a mnemonic. In order to establish universal effects of synesthesia on cognition single-case studies must be complemented by group studies.

AB The neuropsychologic test battery froth the Uniform Data Set (UDS) of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) program of the National Institute on Aging consists of brief Measures of attention, processing speed, executive function, episodic memory, and language. This paper describes development of the battery and preliminary data froth the initial UDS evaluation of 3268 clinically cognitively normal then and women collected over the first 24 months of utilization. The subjects represent a sample of community-dwelling, individuals who volunteer for studies of cognitive aging. Subjects were considered "clinically cognitively normal" based on clinical assessment, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. The results demonstrate performance on tests sensitive to cognitive aging and to the early stages of Alzheimer disease in a relatively well-educated sample. Regression models investigating the impact of age, education, and sex on test scores indicate that these variables will need to be incorporated in subsequent normative studies. Future plans include: (1) determining the psychometric properties of the battery: (2) establishing normative data, including norms for different ethnic minority groups; and (3) conducting longitudinal studies on cognitively normal subjects, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and individuals with Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia.

AB This study assessed the convergent validity of a virtual environment (VE) navigation learning task, the Groton Maze Learning Test (GMLT), and selected traditional neuropsychological tests performed in a group of healthy elderly adults (n = 24). The cohort was divided equally between males and females to explore performance variability due to sex differences, which were subsequently characterized and reported as part of the analysis. To facilitate performance comparisons, specific "efficiency" scores were created for both the VE navigation task and the GMLT. Men reached peak performance more rapidly than women during VE navigation and on the GMLT and significantly outperformed women on the first learning trial in the VE. Results suggest reasonable convergent validity across the VE task, GMLT, and selected neuropsychological tests for assessment of spatial memory.

AB Individuals with current cocaine use disorders (CUD) form a heterogeneous group, making sensitive neuropsychological (NP) comparisons with healthy individuals difficult. The current study examined the effects on NP functioning of four factors that commonly vary among CUD: urine status for cocaine (positive vs negative on study day), cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and dysphoria. Sixty-four cocaine abusers were matched to healthy comparison subjects on gender and race; the groups also did not differ in measures of general intellectual functioning. All subjects were administered an extensive NP battery measuring attention, executive function, memory, facial and emotion recognition, and motor function. Compared with healthy control subjects, CUD exhibited performance deficits on tasks of attention, executive function, and verbal memory (within one standard deviation of controls). Although CUD with positive urine status, who had higher frequency and more recent cocaine use, reported greater symptoms of dysphoria, these cognitive deficits were most pronounced in the CUD with negative urine status. Cigarette smoking, frequency of alcohol consumption, and dysphoria did not alter these results. The current findings replicate a previously reported statistically significant, but relatively mild NP impairment in CUD as compared with matched healthy control individuals and further suggest that frequent/recent cocaine may mask underlying cognitive (but not mood) disturbances. These results call for development of pharmacological agents targeted to enhance cognition, without negatively impacting mood in individuals addicted to cocaine.

AB Spontaneous intrusive recollections (SIRs) follow traumatic events in clinical and non-clinical populations. To determine whether any relationship exists between SIRs and enhanced memory for emotional events, participants viewed emotional or neutral films, had their memory for the films tested two days later, and estimated the number of SIRs they experienced for each film. SIR frequency related positively to memory strength, an effect more pronounced in the emotional condition. These findings represent the first demonstration of a relationship between SIRs occurring after an emotional experience and subsequent memory strength for that experience. The results are consistent with the possibility that emotional arousal leads both to elevated SIR frequency and better memory, and that the covert rehearsal associated with SIRs enhances memory for emotional relative to neutral stimuli. Additional evidence of menstrual cycle influences on SIR incidence in female participants appears to merit consideration in future work. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine expressive language, memory, and higher executive tasks in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) as compared with their siblings and a normal control group under video-EEG conditions.
   Methods: Eight sibling pairs, one in each pair with JME, were compared with 16 controls matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and educational level. The participants were administered a standard comprehensive set of neuropsychological measures to assess emotional well-being, intelligence, memory, language, visuospatial skills, reaction time, attention, and higher executive function, during and without video-EEG recording.
   Results: The JME group differed significantly from controls on measures of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. They also scored significantly higher on the Dysexecutive Questionnaire, being much more likely to report traits associated with executive dysfunction. Qualitative inspection of the data suggested a trend for patients with JME and their siblings to perform worse than controls on some measures, notably those of expressive language and higher executive function, but on other measures the differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, the JME and sibling group performed as well as controls on the Rey Complex Figure and other tests of visuospatial skills.
   Conclusion: The present controlled experimental case series provides support for a neuropsychological profile of patients with JME and their siblings. Significant impairments in verbal and executive functioning may have important ramifications for the social, occupational, and academic performance of people with JME. The apparent corresponding likeness in cognitive performance, exhibited independent of EEG activity, between patients with JME and their siblings warrants further exploration as similar cortical and subcortical structures may be implicated in these two groups.

Brain and Cognition, 47, 470-493] finding of a sex-related difference in favor of females for an object location memory task. Twenty female and 20 male undergraduate students performed both manual and computer-generated versions of the task using stimuli that varied in degree of verbalizability. A 2 x 2 x 3 ANOVA with Sex as a between-subjects factor, and Presentation (manual or computer) and Stimuli (common objects, common shapes, and novel shapes) as within-subjects repeated measures revealed a significant main effect for Sex. Females made fewer errors than males regardless of presentation and across the three levels of verbalizability (i.e., stimulus types); moreover, the effect size was considered "large" [Cohen, J. (1988). Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer]. These findings are interpreted within the context of the current literature that demonstrates a female advantage for object location memory (e.g., [Voyer, D., Postma, A., Brake, B., & ImperatoMcGinley, J.

AB Objective The epsilon 4 allele, a variant of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, is the most prominent genetic risk factor for sporadic, non-familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently known. We investigated the impact of the ApoE-epsilon 4 status on cognitive performance at repeated test administration in elderly non-symptomatic persons, with a specific focus on practice effects.
   Methods Three hundred and fifty-five physically and mentally healthy participants of the Basel Study on the Elderly (119 F, 236 M; age 68.3 +/- 7.6; years of education 12.7 +/- 3. 1; Mini-Mental State scores 29.0 +/- 1.0) were grouped into ApoE epsilon 4 carriers and ApoE epsilon 4 non-carriers (36.9% and 63.1% of the sample, respectively). Participants were assessed at the beginning of the longitudinal study and on average two years later by means of the California Verbal Leaming Test (CVLT) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERADNAB), a multidimensional cognitive test battery. Baseline and change scores were analyzed with multiple regression procedures and adjusted for age, education and gender; change scores were also adjusted for baseline performance.
   Results The ApoE epsilon 4 non-carriers showed slightly better performance with regard to most cognitive parameters at baseline. Mean practice effects of the ApoE epsilon 4 non-carriers in 12 Out Of 13 CVLT variables and in five out of the nine main CERAD-NAB variables were above the 50th percentile, while those of the ApoE epsilon 4 carriers were below the 50th percentile in the respective distributions of test-retest change scores.
   Conclusions The epsilon 4 allele of the ApoE gene has a negative impact on cognitive performance, notably on episodic memory functions, in physically and mentally healthy aged persons. Practice effects seen in carriers of the ApoE epsilon 4 were inferior in most areas tested to the effects seen in ApoE epsilon 4 non-carriers. Further follow-up of these subjects will help to determine the clinical significance of these findings. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently, research has begun to examine sex differences in cognitive functions in schizophrenia and whether such sex differences reflect normal, exaggerated, or reversed sexual dimorphism. This study examined this question by using event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs were recorded in a recognition memory task in 18 patients and 18 matched control subjects. On an early frontal component, the results show an interaction between sex and pathological condition that results in an apparent reversed sexual dimorphism. On mid-latency components, patients show no sex difference on a frontal component, but a difference on the posterior component, whereas healthy subjects show a reverse pattern. Finally, late components show sex difference in the same direction as healthy subjects. These results indicate that the influence of sex on the cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is not homogenous across the information-processing cascade. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present study was to establish if patients with major depression (MD) exhibit a memory bias for sad faces, relative to happy and neutral, when the affective element of the faces is not explicitly processed at encoding. To this end, 16 psychiatric out-patients with MD and 18 healthy, never-depressed controls (HC) were presented with a series of emotional faces and were required to identify the gender of the individuals featured in the photographs. Participants were subsequently given a recognition memory test for these faces. At encoding, patients with MD exhibited a non-significant tendency towards slower gender identification (GI) times, relative to HC, for happy faces. However, the GI times of the two groups did not differ for sad or neutral faces. At memory testing, patients with MD did not exhibit the expected memory bias for sad faces. Similarly, HC did not demonstrate enhanced memory for happy faces. Overall, patients with MD were impaired in their memory for the faces relative to the HC. The current findings are consistent with the proposal that mood-congruent memory biases are contingent upon explicit processing of the emotional element of the to-be-remembered material at encoding.

AB Aims: To assess the role of type 2 diabetes as a risk factor for cognitive decline among elderly people. Methods: Analyses were carried out on data from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging, a study on 5,632 subjects aged 65-84 years, with baseline in 1992 and follow-ups in 1996 and 2000. Results: At baseline, diabetic women had significantly worse scores on all cognitive tests compared to nondiabetic women, but did not show worsening over time, whereas men with diabetes did not show worse scores on cognitive tests at baseline compared to nondiabetic males; however, diabetes in men was associated with a risk of cognitive decline over time, particularly in attention. Higher levels of HbA(1c) were associated with poorer performance on memory tests at follow-up in both sexes. Conclusion: The impact of diabetes on cognitive status might differ in older men and women, probably because of a survival effect, with a higher mortality at a younger age among diabetic men. The metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities associated with diabetes might be responsible for the cognitive decline, at different rates and ages, in men and women. The routine assessment of diabetes complications in the elderly should include cognitive evaluation in both sexes. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The influences of perceived odor qualities on the retention of olfactory information across the adult lifespan were examined. Young (19-36 years), young-old (60-74 years), and old (75-91 years) adults (n = 202) rated a set of unfamiliar odors across a series of perceptual dimensions (i.e., pleasantness, intensity, and irritability) at encoding. The overall results indicated that memory for unpleasant olfactory information was better than that for pleasant odors across the lifespan. Also, participants showed better retention for odors perceived with high intensity and irritability than for odors rated with low or medium scores. Interestingly, the old adults showed selective beneficial memory effects for odors rated as highly irritable. To the extent that perceptions of high irritability reflect an activation of the trigeminal sensory system, this finding suggests that older adults may use trigeminal components in odor information to compensate for age-related impairments in olfactory memory.

AB Studies suggest a link between bone loss and Alzheimer's disease. To examine bone mineral density (BMD) in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relationship to brain structure and cognition, we evaluated 71 patients with early stage AD (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 and 1) and 69 non-demented elderly control participants (CDR 0). Measures included whole body BMD by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and normalized whole brain volumes computed from structural MRI scans. Cognition was assessed with a standard neuropsychological test battery. Mean BMD was lower in the early AD group (1.11 +/- 0.13) compared to the non-demented control group (1.16 +/- 0.12, p = 0.02), independent of age, gender, habitual physical activity, smoking, depression, estrogen replacement, and apolipoprotein E4 carrier status. In the early AD group, BMD was related to whole brain volume (b = 0.18, p = 0.03). BMD was also associated with cognitive performance, primarily in tests of memory (logical memory [b = 0.15, p = 0.04], delayed logical memory [b = 0.16, p = 0.02], and the selective reminding task-free recall [b = 0.18, p = 0.009]). BMD is reduced in the earliest clinical stages of AD and associated with brain atrophy and memory decline, suggesting that central mechanisms may contribute to bone loss in early AD.

AB Previous research suggests that weapons are often inconsistent with the schema activated by eyewitnesses, which leads them to attend to weapons more than they would to neutral objects. Therefore an especially strong weapon focus effect should occur when a perpetrator holds an object primarily associated with the opposite rather than the same gender. As predicted, a handgun reduced the accuracy of witnesses' descriptions of a female perpetrator more than descriptions of a male perpetrator (Experiment 1). Additionally, memory for a female perpetrator was more severely impaired if she carried a folding knife as opposed to a knitting needle, but the reverse was true when the perpetrator was male (Experiment 2). Finally, the weapon focus effect was eliminated for perpetrators of both genders if witnesses saw them as dangerous individuals (Experiment 3).

AB Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to neural and cognitive variation in healthy adults. We examined contribution of three polymorphisms frequently associated with individual differences in cognition (Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase, Va1158Met, Brain-Derived-Neurotrophic-Factor Va166Met, and Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4) and a vascular risk factor (hypertension) in a sample of 199 volunteers (age 18-82). Genotypes were determined from buccal culture samples, and cognitive performance was assessed in 4 age-sensitive domains-fluid intelligence, executive function (inhibition), associative memory, and processing speed. We found that Younger age and COMT Met/Met genotype, associated with low COMT activity and higher prefrontal dopamine content, were independently linked to better performance in most of the tested domains. Homozygotes for Val allele of BDNF polymorphism exhibited better associative memory and faster speed of processing than the Met allele carriers, with greater effect for women and persons with hypertension, Carriers of ApoE epsilon 4 allele evidenced steeper age-related increase in costs of Stroop color interference, but showed no negative effects on memory. The findings indicate that age-related cognitive performance is differentially affected by distinct genetic factors and their interactions with vascular health status.

AB The study investigated the influence of cognitive avoidance, positive affect, and gender on the evaluation of and memory for threat-related information varying in degrees of aversiveness and ambiguity. Stimulus material consisted of threatening, nonthreatening, and ambiguous pictures. First, valence ratings of the stimuli were collected. This phase was followed by a first memory test. A second memory test was administered three days later. Memory for aversive information was influenced by cognitive avoidance, positive affect, and gender. Avoiders exhibited a comparatively good memory for aversive information in the first (immediate) test and a very poor memory in the delayed testing. A similar pattern was obtained for individuals high in positive affect. Compared to men, women gave more negative ratings to aversive and ambiguous pictures and had a better memory for ambiguous information in the immediate test. Results are discussed within the framework of the repressive discontinuity hypothesis proposed by Hock and Krohne [Hock, M., Krohne. H. W. (2004).

AB Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) commonly display characteristics of social anxiety, including gaze aversion, increased time to initiate social interaction, and difficulty forming meaningful peer relationships. While neural correlates of face processing, an important component of social interaction, are altered in FXS, studies have not examined whether social anxiety in this population is related to higher cognitive processes, such as memory. This study aimed to determine whether the neural circuitry involved in face encoding was disrupted in individuals with FXS, and whether brain activity during face encoding was related to levels of social anxiety. A group of 11 individuals with FXS (5 M) and 11 age-and gender-matched control participants underwent fMRI scanning while performing a face encoding task with onlineeye-tracking. Results indicate that compared to the control group, individuals with FXS exhibited decreased activation of prefrontal regions associated with complex social cognition, including the medial and superior frontal cortex, during successful face encoding. Further, the FXS and control groups showed significantly different relationships between measures of social anxiety (including gaze-fixation) and brain activity during face encoding. These data indicate that social anxiety in FXS may be related to the inability to successfully recruit higher level social cognition regions during the initial phases of memory formation.

AB Sex differences in the latent general and broad cognitive abilities underlying the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities were investigated for children, youth, and adults ages 6 through 59. A developmental, multiple indicator-multiple cause, structural equation model was used to investigate sex differences in latent cognitive abilities as well as developmental changes in these differences across the 6 to 59 age span. Females showed a consistent advantage on the latent processing speed (Gs) factor, and males showed a small, consistent advantage on the latent comprehension-knowledge (Gc) factor. Males also showed an advantage on latent quantitative reasoning (RQ) and visual-spatial ability (Gv) factors at most ages, although the latter was statistically significant only for adults. No statistically significant sex differences were shown on latent auditory processing, short-term memory, long-term retrieval, or fluid reasoning factors. The higher-order, latent g factor showed inconsistent differences for children, small, nonsignificant differences favoring females for adolescents, and fairly consistent statistically significant differences favoring females in adulthood. Findings are inconsistent with developmental theory that Suggests males should show an advantage oil g in adulthood. Supplemental analyses suggested that methodological choices, including the use of latent variables versus composites and methods for dealing with missing data, can affect research findings.

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the key molecules modulating brain plasticity. While low circulating levels of BDNF have been suggested to predispose to Alzheimer's disease, very little data are available on its association with cognitive function in general population. We evaluated the association between plasma BDNF levels and cognition in a representative population sample of ageing men and women.
   The subjects (n = 1389) were participants of the Dose-Responses to Exercise Training (DR's EXTRA) Study and represent a random sample of Eastern Finnish people (684 men and 705 women), 57-79 years of age at baseline of the study. Plasma BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological test battery.
   Women had a higher mean (+/- SEM) plasma BDNF level than men (1721 +/- 55 vs. 1495 +/- 54 pg/ml, P < 0.001). In women, 1 SD decrease in BDNF increased the risk for a low score in Naming Test by 53% (95% Cl 1.21-1.92, P < 0.001), in Mini-Mental State Examination by 63% (95% CI 1.21-2.20, P = 0.001), in Word List Memory by 56% (95% Cl 1.08-2.26, P = 0.019), in Word List Recall by 50% (95% Cl 1.10-2.05, P = 0.010), in Word List Saving by 49% (95% Cl 1.12-1.99, P = 0.007), and in Word List Recognition by 64% (95% Cl 1.19-2.25, P = 0.002). Data were adjusted for age, education, depression, impaired glucose metabolism, cardiovascular disease, anti hypertensive medication, lipid lowering medication, use of sex hormones, smoking, alcohol consumption, storing time of plasma in the freezer and platelet count. BDNF was not associated with cognition in men. Present data suggest that plasma BDNF is a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in ageing women. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The methods of simultaneous and memory color matching have been studied for a set of five Munsell color samples by 50 children, 25 boys and 25 girls (ranging in age from? 9 to 11 years). By comparison between this group and one of 50 young adult observers, we can deduce the following: (a) In children, as in young adults, the mean CIELAB total color difference, Delta E-ab*, in simultaneous color matching is lower than the Delta E-ab* by memory color matching. (b) Children matched reference test worse than young adults for orange, bluish green (only boys and men) and yellow green (only girls and women). (c) While men remember, independently of age and delay time, violet reference test worse than women (P = 0.02), boys remember, independently of delay time, reference test worse than girls for orange (P = 0.026) and pink (P = 0.049). (d) In short-term memory, boys remember the reference test better than girls for bluish green (P = 0.022): girls remember yellow green reference test worse than women (P = 0.034). (e) Chroma is the perceptual color attribute that best explains sex differences, although that depends upon the reference color test considered. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

AB The present study compared incidental learning and food memory in children, young adults and elderly people for three sensory modalities (taste, texture and aroma). The relation of gender and liker-status (i.e. how much we like a product) with food memory was also investigated. Participants received a complete meal including a custard dessert used as target under incidental learning conditions. 24 h later, participants were confronted with a series of samples consisting of the target and slightly modified versions of the target (distractors) and were unexpectedly asked to perform an "absolute memory" ("Did you eat this sample yesterday?") and a "relative memory" test ("Is the present sample less/equal/more pleasant than the one you ate yesterday?"). Participants also performed a hedonic and a discrimination test. Memory for the custard was poor and did not depend on age, but it was related to gender, and to how much participants liked the product. Females and high-likers outperformed males and low-likers in the absolute memory task, but they were not better in discriminating the products on both the hedonic and the perceptual dimension. Results also showed that, contrary to common belief, not all sensory aspects that can be discriminated in perception and in liking, are equally well remembered. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

ID FEMALE ADVANTAGE
AB The grocery shopping Virtual Reality Spatial Object-Location Test (VRSOLT) was developed to examine sex differences in spatial object-location memory in a 3D virtual environment that simulates the real world. Forty college students (20 males, 20 females) were tested on the VRSOLT as well as mental rotation and 2D object-location memory tasks. Both convergent and divergent validity was demonstrated. Males showed an advantage on mental rotation, and results of the VRSOLT grocery store test replicated the female object-location advantage seen in 2D tests. A strategy of systematically navigating the environment may aid female encoding for object location.

AB In two separate studies, sex differences in modal-specific elements of working memory were investigated by utilizing words and pictures as stimuli. Groups of men and women performed a free-recall task of words or pictures in which 20 items were presented concurrently and the number of correct items recalled was measured. Following stimulus presentation, half of the participants were presented a verbal-based distraction task. On the verbal working-memory task, performance of men and women was not significantly different in the no-distraction condition. However, in the distraction condition, women's recall was significantly lower than their performance in the no-distraction condition and men's performance in the distraction condition. These findings are consistent with previous research and point to sex differences in cognitive ability Putatively resulting from functional neuroanatomical dissimilarities. On the visual working-memory task, women showed significantly greater recall than men. These findings are inconsistent with previous research and underscore the need for further research.

ID TELEVISION VIOLENCE; INFORMATION; PROGRAMS; APPEALS
AB Research (Bushman, 2005; Bushman & Bonacci, 2002) has claimed to demonstrate that sexual and violent content in television programs inhibits viewers' memory for advertisements. However, that research failed to adequately control other aspects of the programs' content, making interpretation problematic. The present paper attempts to correct these flaws. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that if other aspects of show content are held constant, sex and violence alone do not affect memory for advertisements. Study 3 provides evidence that while sex or violence does not affect memory, other aspects of program content (e.g., plot, humor) do have a significant influence on advertisement memory. Implications of this research on the interpretation of previous research are discussed.

ID CHRONIC NONMALIGNANT PAIN; ORAL OXYCODONE; MORPHINE; PSYCHOMOTOR;

AB Introduction Although several psychotropic drugs can acutely induce an anterograde impairment of memory which impedes new learning, they do not produce retrograde impairments, reducing memory for information learned prior to the drug being administered. However, both anterograde and retrograde memory impairments have been reported following an acute dose of morphine in palliative care patients (Kamboj et al., Pain 117:388-395, 2005).
   Objective The present study was designed to determine: (1) whether similar amnestic effects would be found after a single oral dose of either morphine or oxycodone in healthy volunteers, (2) how generalisable such effects were across a broader range of memory tasks and (3) whether men and women showed a differential response.
   Materials and methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design was used with 18 participants (nine men, nine women) who were administered 10 mg morphine, 5 mg oxycodone and placebo on three separate test days.
   Results On a working memory task, subtle impairments were found in women following both opioids whilst in men only following morphine. On an episodic memory task, women made significantly more source attribution errors after oxycodone and men made more after placebo. Most gender differences were weight related and a range of other measures showed no drug-induced impairments.
   Conclusions We conclude that these standard doses of opioids have only marginal effects on memory. If these findings can be extrapolated to patients with pain, then clinicians can feel confident in prescribing them on an outpatient basis without impacting on patients' daily functioning.

AB In this paper we discuss the results of a study that identified the relationships between different cognitive functions, as measured by selected subtests of the Senior South African Individual Scale - Revised (SSAIS-R) and the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability - Revised (Neale). The SSAIS-R subtests included Vocabulary, Similarities, Story Memory, and Coding. The Neale assesses three different components of reading, namely, rate, accuracy, and comprehension. The sample consisted of 32 Grade 2 boys attending an English-medium, private school in Gauteng and a matched group of girls attending the sister school. Moderate, significant correlations were found between the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests and components of the Neale for both girls and boys. The Story Memory subtest was correlated with components of the Neale for the girls sample only, while no significant relationship was found between the Coding subtest and any aspects of reading for either gender group. The boys scored significantly higher than the girls on the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests, as well as on the reading comprehension component of the Neale, while the girls scored significantly higher on the non-verbal Coding subtest. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Object-location memory is the only spatial task where female subjects have been shown to outperform males. This result is not consistent across all studies, and may be due to the combination of the multi-component structure of object location memory with the conditions under which different studies were done. Possible gender differences in object location memory and its component object identity memory were assessed in the present study. In order to disentangle these two components, an object location memory task (in which objects had to be relocated in daily environments), and a separate object identity recognition task were carried out. This study also focused on the conditions under which object locations were encoded and retrieved. Only half of the participants were aware of the fact that object locations had to be retrieved later on. Moreover, by applying the 'process dissociation procedure' to the object location memory assessments and the 'remember-know' paradigm to the object identity measure, the amount of explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) retrieval was estimated for each component. In general, females performed better than males on the object location memory task. However, when controlled for object identity memory, females no longer outperformed males, whereas they did not obtain a higher general object identity memory score, nor did they have more explicit or implicit recollection of the object identities. These complicated effects might stem from a difference between males and females, in the way locations or associations between objects and locations are retrieved. In general, participants had more explicit (conscious) recollection than implicit (unconscious) recollection. No effect of encoding context was found, nor any interaction effect of gender, encoding and retrieval context. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The nanopeptide oxytocin has physiological functions during labour and lactation. In addition, oxytocin is known to modulate aggression, anxiety, social behaviour and cognition. Little is known about its effects on memory for emotional stimuli. In the present single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study we have investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single post-learning dose (20 IU) of intranasal oxytocin on memory for facial identity and expression in 36 healthy young females and males using a face portrait recognition test. In the acquisition phase of the test, 60 different male faces with happy, angry or neutral expressions were presented to the volunteers. Thirty minutes and 24h after oxytocin administration, recognition memory tests were performed using portraits with neutral facial expressions, only. Oxytocin improved identity recognition memory independently of participant's gender, for neutral and angry faces, whereas this effect was not present for happy faces. Oxytocin-treated subjects had a lower bias to judge not previously seen faces as being previously seen. Oxytocin had no effect on facial expression memory. In conclusion, oxytocin has distinct effects on memory performance for facial identity and may contribute to the modulation of social behaviour. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A commonly used test of non-verbal memory, which measures recognition for unfamiliar face pictures, was developed by Warrington (1984), the Recognition Memory for Faces (RMF) test. The task has been widely used in adults in relation to neurological impairment of face recognition. We examined the relationship of RMF scores to age in 500 young people aged between 6 and 16 years. A linear relationship obtained between 6 and 10 years, followed by a 'plateau' between the ages of 10 and 13, followed by further improvement. Abilities on the test correlated with both verbal and non-verbal intelligence, but the nonlinear function relating age and RMF survived partialling for intelligence in the younger age groups. The improvement of the adolescents compared with older children also survived partialling for IQ. We found no significant influence of gender or reported pubertal status (which was not obtained for all participants) on RMF once age was taken into account. Performance on other face-processing tasks (emotion classification and accuracy in line of sight detection) correlated significantly, if moderately, with RMF scores. Despite its age and imperfections, RMF test may nevertheless be a useful indicator of 'face expertise' in a developmental context.

AB BACKGROUND: In 1979 approximately 2,000 people were exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) due to ingestion of contaminated cooking oil in Taiwan. Although a previous study has shown delayed developmental milestones and poorer neurocognitive functioning in children born to exposed mothers, it is unclear whether neurocognitive functioning was impaired in people who were directly exposed to the PCBs and PDCFs.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare neurocognitive functioning in people exposed to PCBs and PCDFs with that of unexposed sex- and age-matched neighbors.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among exposed and unexposed subjects >= 60 years of age using prospective outcome measurements. We evaluated neurocognitive tests including cognition, memory modalities, learning, motor and sensory function, mood, and daily activity.
   RESULTS: In total, 162 (59%) exposed and 151 (55%) reference subjects completed this study. In exposed men, all test results were similar to the reference group; however, exposed women had reduced functioning in attention and digit span (ADS), visual memory span (VMS), and verbal memory recalls (VMR), especially learning ability. We also found a borderline reduction in the Mini-Mental State Examination. The digit symbol, motor, sensory, depression (determined by the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form), and activity of daily life were not different between the exposed and reference groups. A significant dose-response relationship was found for VMR, ADS, and VMS.
   CONCLUSION: Our study showed dose-dependent neurocognitive deficits in certain aspects of attention, visual memory, and learning ability in women previously exposed to PCBs and PCDFs, but not in exposed men.

AB In some situations, memory is enhanced by stressful experience, while in others, it is impaired. The specific components of the stress-response that may result in these differing effects remain unclear, and the current study sought to address this knowledge gap. Forty healthy participants (20 women, 20 men) were exposed to emotionally arousing and neutral pictures. Twenty-four hours later, 20 participants underwent a social stressor (speech and math tests), and 20 underwent a control reading task, both followed by a delayed free recall task. Cortisol responders to the stress condition (5 men and 1 woman) showed reduced memory retrieval for both neutral and emotionally arousing pictures. Men and women in the stress condition who did not produce a cortisol response showed increased retrieval of unpleasant pictures compared to controls. The results provide further evidence that cortisol is a primary effector in the stress-induced memory retrieval deficit. At the same time, stress can enhance memory retrieval performance, especially for emotional stimuli, when the cortisol response is absent. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Steroid hormones modulate memory in animals and human adults. Little is known on the developmental effects of these hormones on the neural networks underlying memory. Using Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) as a naturalistic mode( of early steroid abnormalities, this study examines the consequences of CAH on memory and its neural correlates for emotionally arousing and neutral material in children. Seventeen patients with CAH and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy children (ages 12-14 years) completed the study. Subjects were presented positive, negative and neutral pictures. Memory recall occurred about 30 min after viewing the picture. Children with CAH showed memory deficits for negative pictures compared to healthy children (p<0.01). There were no group differences on memory performance for either positive or neutral pictures (p>0.1). In patients, 24 h urinary-free cortisol levels (reflecting glucocorticoid replacement therapy) and testosterone levels were not associated with memory performance. These findings suggest that early steroid imbalances affect memory for negative material in children with CAH. Such memory impairments may result from abnormal brain organization and function following hormonal dysfunction during critical periods of development. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current research examined whether visuospatial recall of both abstract and common objects was related to gender or object familiarity. Seventy two undergraduates from a university in the Southern U.S. were asked to draw the Rey Complex Figure and a series of common objects from memory. A pilot sample of seventy three undergraduates had previously identified common objects as "male" "female" and "neutral" exemplars. Males were significantly better at drawing "male" and "neutral" exemplars whereas females were better at drawing "female" exemplars. Neither gender was significantly better at the Rey task. These results question whether males have an inherent advantage in visual memory. Results also found that experience with playing violent video games was associated with higher visual memory recall.

A standard battery of neurobehavioral tests covering learning and memory, visual-motor function, and attention was administered at baseline and during seven subsequent years. Normative test data are presented separately by gender and by age at study inception (younger versus older). Results provide normative data for use in clinical settings, where dissociations in performance between cognitive domains need to be identified for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

AB Background Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a condition with an increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, gender differences are neglected in the assessment of MCI and AD. Methods We examined verbal and visuospatial episodic memory in 143 subjects diagnosed as healthy controls (HC; N = 48, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29.2 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- standard deviation)), MCI (N = 43,MMSE 28.5 +/- 1.4), and AD (N = 49, MMSE 25.1 +/- 2.2). Results Female HC and MCI subjects performed better on verbal episodic memory tasks than males. In contrast, visuospatial episodic memory was better in male than female AD patients. Conclusions We interpret the results in light of a genderspecific cognitive reserve and conclude that the gender-specificity of neuropsychological performance needs to be accounted for in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB The abilities of males and females to make spatial inferences were compared. Spatial inference is concerned with the ability to work out new spatial information from memory. In two experiments, participants had to study line drawings depicting shapes linked either by straight or meandering lines. Afterwards, they had to remember the straight-line distances or to infer the straight-line distances. Several spatial abilities were also assessed: perceptual discrimination, mental rotation, and visuo-spatial working memory span. The results showed that males outperformed females in spatial inference and mental rotation. Experiment 2 extended the study to old people. The results replicated and clarified those obtained in Experiment 1. Spatial inference and mental rotation showed age-related and gender-related differences; in addition, age reduced the visuo-spatial memory span. Overall, the findings suggest that gender differences favouring males are maximised with tasks requiring active processing and strategic control of metric information.

AB The prion protein Met129Val polymorphism has recently been related to human long-term memory with carriers of either the 129(MM) or the 129(MV) genotype recalling 17% more words than 129(VV) carriers at 24 h following learning. Here, we sampled genotype differences in retrieval-related brain activity at 30 min and 24 h following learning. Furthermore, genotype groups were compared regarding grey matter concentrations and cognitive profiles. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a word recognition task on 12 Met/Met carriers, 12 Val/Met carriers, and 12 Val/Val carriers. These groups were matched for retrieval performance, gender, age, education, and other memory-related genetic polymorphisms. Although retrieval performance was matched, Val carriers exhibited enhanced retrieval-related brain activity at 30 min and 24 h following learning. At both time lags, correlations between retrieval-related brain activity and retrieval success were negative for Val homozygotes (the more activity, the worse retrieval success), while correlations showed no significance or were positive for Met homozygotes and heterozygotes. These results suggest a less economic use of retrieval-related neural resources in Val relative to Met carriers. Furthermore, Val carriers exhibited higher neocortical grey matter concentrations compared to Met carriers. When controlling for grey matter concentration, genotype effects in retrieval-related brain activity remained significant. Val and Met carriers yielded comparable brain activations for correct rejections of non-studied words and for working memory, which speaks to the specificity of the genotype effect. Findings suggest that the prion protein Met129Val polymorphism affects neural plasticity following learning at a time-scale of minutes to hours. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two studies examined motivation and content domain as possible influences on sex differences in interpersonal sensitivity. Although much research has found women to excel on tasks measuring interpersonal sensitivity, most of the tasks have measured accuracy in female-relevant domains such as emotion. The present studies measured interpersonal sensitivity, defined as accurate recall of another person, for both female-relevant and male-relevant content domains and also included motivational manipulations intended to influence men and women differently. Study 1 measured accuracy of recalling information in a written vignette about a person, and Study 2 measured accuracy of recalling details about an interaction partner. Both studies supported hypotheses about domain specificity and gender-relevant motivation. However, even for male-stereotypic content and for tasks framed to favor men's motivation to perform well, men's accuracy never exceeded women's.

AB Objective: The Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test is a widely recognized test in neuropsychological literature to evaluate learning and memory. This paper presents the performance of six age groups of Brazilian elderly on the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test. Method: A version of the test was developed with a list of high-frequency one-syllable and two-syllable concrete Portuguese substantives. Two hundred and twenty-three subjects of both genders were allocated to 6 age groups (60-64, 65-69; 70-74; 7579; 80-84 and 85-89 years old) and tested with the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test. Results: Educational level and age had a positive and a negative correlation, respectively, with performance on the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test. Women performed significantly better than men. Our results were similar to those found for the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test English version, across similar age ranges. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the Brazilian Portuguese Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test 14 adaptation was adequate and applicable for evaluating the memory capacity of Brazilian subjects, across similar age and educational levels.

AB Event-related functional MRI (fMRI) was used to assess brain activity during encoding of fearful and neutral faces in 12 women and 12 men. In a subsequent memory analysis, the authors separated successful from unsuccessful encoding of both types of faces, based on whether they were remembered or forgotten in a later recognition memory test. Overall, women and men recruited overlapping neural circuitries. Both sexes activated right-sided medial-temporal regions during successful encoding of fearful faces. Successful encoding of neutral faces was associated with left-sided lateral prefrontal and right-sided superior frontal activation in both sexes. In women, relatively greater encoding related activity for neutral faces was seen in the superior parietal and parahippocampal cortices. By contrast, men activated the left and right superior/middle frontal cortex more than women during successful encoding of the same neutral faces. These findings suggest that women and men use similar neural networks to encode facial information, with only subtle sex differences observed for neutral faces.

AB Background: Cognitive impairment plays a role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has important consequences for patient management. However, many aspects of cognitive impairment in PD remain unclear because of the use of different and often invalid measurement instruments. In this study, a reliable and valid instrument, the SCales for Outcomes in PArkinson's disease-COGnition (SCOPA-COG), was used.
   Aim: To evaluate cognitive functioning in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease and to assess the relations with demographic, disease related and clinical variables.
   Methods: A cohort of 400 patients with PD was evaluated for cognition, motor and non-motor domains, as well as for demographic and disease related characteristics.
   Results were compared with 150 controls matched for overall age, sex and education distribution. Results: Patients with PD scored significantly lower on all cognitive subdomains compared with controls, with the largest differences for executive functioning and memory. After correction for age and years of education, 22% of patients had impaired cognition, as measured by the total SCOPA-COG score, compared with controls. Across all patients, more severe cognitive impairment was associated with significantly more impairment in motor, autonomic, depressive and psychotic domains. Patients with the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) dominant phenotype showed more cognitive impairment compared with patients with the tremor dominant phenotype. Contrary to tremor scores, PIGD scores significantly worsened with increasing disease severity.
   Conclusions: Cognition is an important domain of the clinical spectrum of PD and poorer cognitive performance is associated with greater impairment in motor and non-motor domains in PD. The difference in cognitive scores between PIGD dominant patients and tremor dominant patients likely reflects more advanced disease.

AB To clarify polarity, topography, and time course of recognition memory ERP old/new effects during matched visual and auditory continuous word recognition tasks, unrestricted temporal PCA jointly analyzed stimulus- and responselocked, reference- free current source densities (31- channel, N=40). Randomization tests provided unbiased statistics for complete factor topographies. Old/new left parietal source effects were complemented by lateral frontocentral sink effects in both modalities, overlapping modality- specific P3 sources 160 ms preresponse. A mid-frontal sink 45 ms postresponse terminated the frontoparietal generator pattern, showed old/ new effects consistent with bilateral activation of anterior cingulate and SMA, and preceded similar activity extending posteriorly along the longitudinal fissure. These methods separated old/ new stimulus source (preresponse) and response sink (postresponse) effects from motor and modality- specific ERPs.

AB Gonadal steroid effects during puberty are often hypothesized to account for the male advantage seen in certain spatial tasks. One spatial task where males consistently show better performance than females is the Morris Water Task in which subjects must navigate to a goal location in a pool. We examined whether sex differences exist in pre-pubertal children completing a Virtual Morris Water Task, which has previously shown strong sex differences in adults. Pre-pubertal boys show superior performance to similar-aged girls, as evidenced by shorter latencies to find the platform and stronger preferences for the platform location during a probe trial. These results suggest that sex differences in spatial learning and memory exist prior to puberty and do not appear to require the effects of sex hormones at puberty. Rather, these differences may reflect early-life hormonal effects on hippocampal-dependent processes and may suggest different preferential learning strategies by boys and girls.

AB We examined sex differences in spatial navigation performance using an ecologically relevant experimental paradigm in which virtual maze-like museums are projected in front of a treadmill. Thirty-two 20-30-year-old adults (16 women/16 men) performed a way-finding task in city-block (straight corridors) or variable (irregular corridors) topographies while walking on the treadmill. Sex differences in spatial navigation performance were reduced in variable topographies, suggesting less reliance on spatial relational learning among women. Also, spatial geometric knowledge of the mazes continued to be higher in men after all participants had attained perfect place-finding performance. Results indicate that sex differences in spatial navigation performance are modulated by interactions between environmental demands and sex differences in spatial processing.

AB There are a variety of well-established neuropsychological tests that are helpful in identifying global and specific verbal memory deficits. In contrast, tests of visual memory have produced less consistent results likely due in part to confounding variable's such as verbal.ficient differentiation of among types of encodability, administration difficulties, and insufficient memory. The Brown Location Test (BLT) was designed to specifically measure visual memory for location of identical objects (dots) and address limitations found in commonly employed visual memory tests. This paper describes the empirical basis for the BLT and reports the psychometric properties of the test. Results indicate good internal and alternate form reliabilities. Factor analysis of a brief test battery confirmed that BLT performance is generally independent of verbal memory and global intellectual abilities. BLT performance declined with age, but there was no association between performance and gender, education, or intellectual functioning. In view of the favorable psychometric properties observed during preliminary studies, additional normative and validation studies in healthy and patient populations are warranted.

AB Background and objective The Seven Minute Screen (7MS) is a brief cognitive case-finding instrument for dementia. The test is composed of four subtests that assess performance with regard to orientation, memory, visuospatial ability and language. The objective of this study was to describe 7MS performance in a normal sample of people aged 65 years and older.
   Method The subjects were 66 Norwegian community-dwellers who met selection criteria modified from the Mayo Older American Normative Studies standard. Mean age was 73.2 years, age range was 65-93 years, and mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 29.06, range 26-30.
   Results Analysis of the 7MS subtests revealed relatively modest influence of age, education and gender on test performance. The composite 7MS performance scores were associated with education. Normal performance was expressed as means, standard deviations and percentile values for the age groups 65-74 years and 75 + years.
   Conclusion 7MS performance is described for a normal sample. These data have the potential to increase the clinicians' ability to interpret 7MS test results. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the role of adolescent IQ (AIQ) and gender in older adults' ability to use cognitive support to enhance memory. Subjects were 269 mid-1940s graduates of the same high school. Adolescent IQ scores were gathered from archives, and subjects' memory for words was tested with tasks that provided increasing cognitive support. Overall, subjects benefited from support; women recalled more words than men; and persons with a high AIQ remembered more words than persons with a lower AIQ. However, while all subjects showed gains from cognitive support, men with a lower AIQ performed worse than men with a high AIQ. Women's performance was not dependent on their AIQ. Analysis of qualitative memory indicators suggested that women and persons with a high AIQ had better encoding and retrieval operations. Men with a lower AIQ appear to be particularly vulnerable to memory deficits in aging. This may be due to low "cognitive reserve" or generally poorer episodic memory function.

AB Context: The stress responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can produce adverse effects on the brain. Previous studies have concluded that an elevated level of cortisol is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and decline in aging but have been limited by sex exclusion, restricted cognitive batteries, and small sample sizes.
   Objective: To examine associations among salivary cortisol metrics and cognitive domain scores in an urban adult population.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a longitudinal study involving 1140 Baltimore, Maryland, residents aged 50 to 70 years. Four salivary cortisol samples were obtained from 967 participants across 1 study visit (before, during, and after cognitive testing as well as at the end of the visit) from which 7 cortisol metrics were created. We examined associations of cortisol metrics with cognitive performance using multiple linear regression.
   Main Outcome Measures: Performance on 20 standard cognitive tests was measured and combined to form summary measures in 7 domains (language, processing speed, eye-hand coordination, executive functioning, verbal memory and learning, visual memory, and visuoconstruction).
   Results: Higher levels of pretest and mean cortisol as well as the area under the curve of cortisol over the study visit were associated with worse performance (P <. 05) in 6 domains (language, processing speed, eye-hand coordination, executive functioning, verbal memory and learning, and visual memory). For instance, an interquartile range increase in the area under the curve was equivalent to a decrease in the language score expected from an increase in 5.6 (95% confidence interval, 4.27.1) years of age.
   Conclusions: Elevated cortisol was associated with poorer cognitive function across a range of domains in this large population-based study. We believe the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation may be a risk factor for poorer cognitive performance in older persons.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AGE
AB The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) are frequently used in assessing dementia. Though sex differences in verbal learning and memory have been reported, normative data for the elderly often do not separate males and females. No studies provide normative data for both the RAVLT and the BVMT-R in the same elderly sample. Finally, normative data for those over age 79 are unavailable for the BVMT-R. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate sex differences on these two tests, provide normative data in 172 healthy volunteers between the ages of 60 and 89 (inclusive), and extend the age range of BVMT-R normative data. Females consistently outperformed males. However, only performance on the RAVLT warranted separation of normative data by sex. Age and sex differences as well as usage of these normative data in a clinical setting are discussed.

AB The present study examined sexual orientation-related differences in object location memory by using 3 object arrays (testing object exchange, object shift, and novel objects conditions) and 1 metric positional memory array. Heterosexual women and homosexual men significantly outperformed heterosexual men in all 3 object arrays. However, there were no group differences in metric positional memory. Heterosexual males expectedly outperformed the other groups in spatial perception (Judgment of Line Orientation; A. L. Benton, K. D. Hamsher, N. R. Varney, & O. Spreen, 1983). Regression modeling revealed that sexual orientation and spatial perception predicted object exchange performance, whereas recalled childhood gender nonconformity, a robust developmental marker of adult sexual orientation, predicted object shift and novel object performance alone. A measure ascribed to the actions of prenatal androgens, the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio, did not predict object location memory. These data may limit possible developmental pathways for sexual variation in selective forms of spatial memory.

AB We aimed to determine the severity and pattern of cognitive dysfunction in patients with basal ganglia (BG) hemorrhage within the first 6 months after stroke and to identify its clinical correlates. The study samples consisted of 30 patients with BG hemorrhage and 37 healthy controls. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery including tests of attention, memory, language, visuospatial function, and executive function was administered to all participants. Relative to healthy controls, BG patients performed significantly worse across different cognitive domains after controlling for age, sex, and education. 96.7% of patients displayed defective performance on at least three neuropsychological tests. Discriminant function analysis showed that visuospatial function and memory were the best predictors of group membership (patient/control), with an overall classification rate of 95.5%. Only side of stroke and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score correlated significantly with some of the cognitive domains. The widespread pattern of cognitive deficits seen in BG patients provides evidence for the substantial involvement of the BG in many neuronal pathways connecting cortical and subcortical brain areas responsible for various cognitive functions.

AB Women have been found to outperform men on face recognition tasks, specifically in the recognition of female faces. Men do not seem to exhibit a corresponding own-sex bias. To examine the generality and possible reasons for these patterns, 107 men and 112 women viewed faces of both children and adults of either Swedish or Bangladeshi origin, for later recognition. As expected, women were especially good at remembering female faces, but also outperformed men on male faces. Men did not show an own-sex bias. Thus, regardless of age and ethnicity of the faces, women performed at a higher level than men on both female and male faces, possibly reflecting enhanced interest in faces, and in particular, female faces.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Objectives. The aims of the present study were (a) to examine the effects of age, gender and IQ on the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT), (b) to identify the best scores to use in interpreting test performance and (c) to compare the results with available normative data.
   Design. Participants were 117 normal volunteers, 60 males and 57 females, with an age range of 16-69 years and a mean age of 39.84 years (SD = 16.26).
   Methods. Participants completed copy, 30-second immediate recall and delayed recall trials of the ROCFT Data consisted of raw scores from the three trials and percent-retained scores for the memory trials.
   Results. Significant effects of age, gender and IQ were found on the copy trial and on the raw scores for the memory trials. Expressing the memory scores as a proportion of the copy score reduced these effects, but did not eliminate them. Only a 'pure' measure of delayed retention was found to be independent of age, gender and IQ.
   Conclusion. Results are discussed in relation to the adequacy of available norms, and the ideal scores to use for the ROUT are identified. Caution is urged in interpreting scores on the ROCFT due to the danger of misclassification if currently available norms are used.

AB In studies of autobiographical memory, women typically remember more emotional information than do men. The present study evaluated whether women recall more emotional information than men when the content of an event is controlled. Participants read a script containing emotional and neutral information, under instructions to prepare advice for the characters addressing either interpersonal issues (emotional focus), concrete plans (neutral focus), or with no particular topic suggested (undirected focus). After writing out advice, on a surprise memory test women recalled more emotional information than men in all focus conditions with no deficit in neutral recall. Women recalled more neutral information than men in the neutral focus condition. A measure of emotional sensitivity mediated the gender difference in emotional recall suggesting that memory for emotional information is not solely a function of gender.

AB The objective of this study was to determine a possible differential effect of age, education, and sex on cognitive speed, verbal memory, executive functioning, and verbal fluency in healthy older adults. A group of 578 healthy participants in the age range of 64-81 was recruited from a large population study of healthy adults (Maastricht Aging Study). Even in healthy individuals in this restricted age range, there is a clear, age-related decrease in performance on executive functioning, verbal fluency, verbal memory, and cognitive speed tasks. The capacity to inhibit information is affected most. Education had a substantial effect on cognitive functioning: participants with a middle or high level of education performed better on cognitive tests than did participants with a low level of education. Women performed better than men on verbal memory tasks. Therefore, education and sex must be taken into account when examining an older individual's cognitive performance.

AB The Memory in Reality (MIR) test, or Apartment Test, was designed as an ecologically valid alternative to word list recall measures. Participants name 10 everyday objects, place them in a scale model of an apartment and after a delay with interference, recall the objects and their placement. Two studies are reported. Study 1 included 51 older adult volunteers. Study 2 was a population-based sample of 633 older twins. The Apartment Test Recall and Placement tasks were highly correlated with word list delayed recall. Ecological validity was supported by correlations with informant reports of participants' functioning. Apartment Test Recall was not affected by education. Analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) showed Apartment Test Recall performed as well as word list delayed recall in distinguishing participants with and without dementia. We conclude that the Apartment Test is a valid measure of verbal memory with evidence of ecological and concurrent validity.

AB The Rey Visual Design Learning Test (Rey, 1964, cited in Spreen & Strauss, 1991, Wilhelm, 2004) assesses immediate memory span, new learning, delayed recall and recognition for nonverbal material. Two studies are presented that focused on the construct validity of the RVDLT in primary and secondary school children. In the first study, primary school children performed the RVDLT and the Biber Figural Learning Test, as well as the WISC-R Block design Test, Boston Naming Test, and the Trailmaking Test, to assess discriminant validity. In the second study, the age range was expanded and the subtest Visual Reproductions of the Wechsler Memory Scale with a Delayed recall phase was used to assess the construct validity. A test for visual-motor integration and a test for allention, concentration, and speed of information processing were also added to complete the test battery for assessing discriminant validity. Moderate to high correlations were found between scores on the RVDLT and the tests used to assess construct validity. The correlational pattern of RVDLT scores and the scores on the discriminant tests is discussed.

AB Background: Moderate alcohol drinking is suggested to be beneficial for cognitive functions, but the results of previous studies have varied greatly. Little is known about the effects of midlife alcohol drinking on the cognitive functions later in life. Methods: Participants were derived from random, population-based samples studied in Eastern Finland in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. A total of 1,341 participants were reexamined in 1998, after an average follow-up period of 21 years, at ages 65-79 years. Results: The participants who did not drink alcohol at midlife had a poorer performance in episodic memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function in late life as compared with infrequent and frequent drinkers, adjusted for sociodemographic and vascular factors. Also late-life nondrinkers had poorer psychomotor speed and executive function. These findings were evident especially among nonsmokers. Further, no interactions between apolipoprotein E4 and alcohol or sex and alcohol were found. Conclusions: Alcohol drinking both at midlife and later is favorably related to the function in several cognitive domains, including episodic memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function, in late life. However, it is not clear whether the association is causal, what is the possible mechanism, and what would be a safe limit of drinking for the best cognitive function. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

AB Among possible markers of age-related cognitive decline, uric acid (UA) is controversial because it has antioxidant properties but is increased in diseases that often lead to cognitive impairment. In this study of 96 elderly adults, participants with mildly elevated (but normal) serum UA were 2.7 to 5.9 times more likely to score in the lowest quartile of the sample on measures of processing speed, verbal memory, and working memory. Even after controlling for age, sex, race, education, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol abuse, the multivariate-adjusted odds of poor verbal memory and working memory remained significant (ps <.05). Despite its antioxidant properties, these findings suggest that even mild elevations of UA might increase the risk of cognitive decline among older adults.

   PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; ASSOCIATIONS; VAL158MET
AB A common polymorphism (Val158Met) in the gene encoding for the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme has been associated with differences in prefrontal cognitive function in schizophrenic patients and healthy adults. While several studies indicate that the Met allele is associated with better performance on measures of executive function, working memory and verbal fluency, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, fewer studies have investigated this relationship in older adults, a group known to experience impairments in prefrontal cognitive functions. Additionally, findings vary according to the gender distribution of study participants.
   We examined whether COMT genotype interacted with gender to impact cognition in a cohort of 163 healthy, older adults. Memory, verbal ability and areas of prefrontal cognitive function, including attention, speed-of-processing, and executive function, were assessed. We found no significant association between COMT genotype and any cognitive measure. However, gender interacted with COMT genotype to impact cognitive performance. Males homozygous for the Val allele performed better than both the Val/Met and Met/Met groups on measures of delayed recall. Heterozygous women performed better than their homozygous counterparts on the measure of verbal ability. These findings suggest that gender may be an important variable in consideration of the impact of COMT on cognition. Further, when gender is taken into consideration, any negative impact of COMT genotype may extend to cognitive domains other than those associated with prefrontal regions.

AB This study examines the applicability of the modified Location Learning Test (mLLT) as a test of spatial memory in neuropsychological patients. Three groups of participants were examined: stroke patients, patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy participants (N = 411). Three error measures were computed, the Total Score (index of overall performance), the Learning Index (the learning curve over subsequent trials) and the Delayed Recall Score, measuring decay over time. The Learning Index was the most sensitive measure, showing differences between the three groups as well as lateralization effects within the stroke group. Also, the mLLT correlated significantly with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, as well as with age and education level. Regression-based normative data were computed based on the healthy participants. In all, the mLLT appears to be a sensitive and valid test for the detection of object-location memory impairments in clinical groups. (c) 2006 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

AB The methods of simultaneous and successive color matching have been compared for a set of five Munsell color samples by 50 older adult observers, 25 men and 25 women (ranging in age from 64 to 80 years). From comparison between this population and one of 50 younger adult observers, 25 men and 25 women (in the 20-27 age range), we can deduce, in general, the following: (a) In the elderly adults the mean CIELAB total color difference (Delta E*(ab)) in simultaneous color matching is lower than the Delta E*(ab) by memory color matching. (b) While younger adults matched well the color of all the reference tests, the elderly adults matched poorly both greens and orange. (c) Younger adults remember the original color better than do the older adults (P = 0.007), depending on gender and delay time. (d) Although with simultaneous matching, the observer's gender does not determine significant differences, by memory, men matched the color of reference test more poorly than did women (P = 0.0), independently of age, color and delay time, especially for bluish green, violet, and pink.

AB The influence of sex on face recognition memory was studied in 49 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, 20 patients with generalized epilepsy, and 32 healthy controls. After learning 20 faces, serially presented for 5 seconds each, subjects had to recognize the 20 among 40 faces (including 20 new faces) immediately and 24 hours later. Women had better face recognition than men, with no significant differences between groups. Women's advantage was due mainly to superior delayed recognition. Taken together, the results Suggest that sex has a similar impact on face recognition in patients with epilepsy and healthy controls, and that testing delayed face recognition raises sensitivity for sex differences. The influence of sex on face recognition in patients with epilepsy should be acknowledged when evaluating individuals or comparing groups. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The cognitive domains examined included calculation, episodic memory, spatial visualization, and global cognitive ability In general, men performed at a higher level than women on tasks assessing calculation and spatial visualization, whereas women performed at a higher level than men on the episodic memory task. Notably, the pattern of cognitive sex differences was similar irrespective of nationality and literacy, although the magnitude of the male advantage was inversely related to level of education. Finally, the low performance of the illiterate women demonstrated the penalizing effect restrictions in public exposure might have on cognitive performance.

AB Objective: Recent evidence suggests that higher peripheral levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) are associated with poorer cognitive function and predict future cognitive decline among the elderly. The current investigation extends the study of relationships between plasma IL-6 and cognitive performance to healthy middle-aged adults and to an examination of more specific cognitive domains. Methods: Five hundred relatively healthy community volunteers aged 30 to 54 bad blood drawn for the determination of plasma IL-6 levels and completed a battery of neuropsychological tests evaluating memory and executive function. Results: After controlling for age, gender, race, and education, hierarchical regression analyses revealed an inverse relationship between circulating levels of IL-6 and performance on clusters of tests assessing auditory recognition memory, attention/working memory, and executive function. In contrast, there was no association between IL-6 and performance on tests of general memory. Secondary analyses demonstrated that relationships between IL-6 and auditory recognition and working memory and executive function were independent of a number of health factors, including body mass index, smoking, and hypertension. Conclusions: These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence linking chronic inflammation to poorer cognitive functioning and extend these findings to a midlife community sample, raising the possibility that IL-6 may represent a biomarker for risk of future cognitive decline.

AB Human tests designed to mirror rodent tests of object recognition and spatial navigation were administered to adult cognitively healthy humans. Facial recognition was also assessed. There was no sex difference in facial recognition, consistent with earlier studies. In the object recognition test, the test-retest NINL total scores during the same visit were highly correlated, comparable to the test-retest correlations obtained in the established facial recognition test. There were no effects of sex on object recognition. However, in the spatial navigation test, there were effects of sex on spatial learning and memory during the session with the hidden, but not visible, target. These tests might be useful to compare assessments of object recognition and spatial learning and memory in humans and animal models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The experimental study reported here investigated information processing of broadcast news at the intersection of audience gender (male versus female) and message valence (positive, negative, and ambiguous). Both audio and video dimensions of stimuli were manipulated to create the three valence frames. The data produced interactions between gender and message valence for self-reported arousal, as well as recognition memory and comprehension of news content. In particular, male viewers are associated with a negativity bias, reporting the highest arousal levels and producing the best recognition memory and comprehension scores for negatively valenced messages. Women, in contrast, show signs of an avoidance response to negatively framed news, rating positively valenced stories as more arousing as well as processing such messages more effectively than negatively framed messages. Within the information-processing paradigm these findings suggest that the gender variable deserves more research attention. The results also have implications for journalism practitioners.

AB Background: There are few investigations of the potential recovery of neurocognitive function in chronic alcoholic samples after very-long-term abstinence. The current study examined cognitive abilities in middle-aged (mean age 46.8 years), long-term abstinent alcoholic individuals (LTAA). Twenty-five LTAA men and 23 LTAA women abstinent for an average of 6.7 years were compared with an equal number of gender and age-comparable normal controls (NC). We examined the association of neurocognitive variables with age, duration of abstinence, alcohol use measures, and the density of a family history of problem drinking.
   Methods: Long-term abstinent alcoholic individuals and NC underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Performance was measured in the following 9 domains: abstraction/cognitive flexibility, attention, auditory working memory, immediate memory, delayed memory, psychomotor function, reaction time, spatial processing, and verbal skills.
   Results: Long-term abstinent alcoholic individuals performed similarly to NC, except for deficits in the spatial processing domain. The spatial processing results must be interpreted with caution because of multiple comparison issues; however, spatial processing deficits are among the impairments most often reported in abstinent alcoholic individuals. None of the cognitive measures were associated with length of abstinence, any alcohol use variable, or family history measure.
   Conclusions: Very-long-term abstinence resolves most neurocognitive deficits associated with alcoholism, except for the suggestion of lingering deficits in spatial processing.

AB In past research, emotion has been classified as basic, self-conscious or self-conscious evaluative, with each type of emotion being progressively more difficult for children to understand (Lewis, M. (2000a). In M. Lewis & J.M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.), Handbook of emotions (2nd ed., pp. 265 - 280), New York, NY: The Guilford Press). Although researchers have examined children's understanding of individual emotions (e.g., guilt), researchers have not assessed children's understanding and memory for emotions based on this classification. In the present research, 6-, 8- and 10-year-old children's memory and understanding of basic, self-conscious and self-conscious evaluative emotions were examined. Although a memory advantage was found for emotions, this effect was less so for the younger children and less so for non-basic emotions. In fact, 6-year-old children and, to a lesser extent 8-year-old children, were more likely than older children to recall self-conscious and self-conscious evaluative emotions with basic emotion labels, and were more likely to explain them using basic emotion labels. Overall, negative emotions (e. g., mad, guilt) were better recalled than positive emotions (e. g., happy, pride), regardless of type of emotion. Gender differences were found as girls were more likely to remember emotion than boys, especially when the emotion action was specifically labeled and a female character experienced it.

AB Rationale Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning.
   Objectives The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans.
   Methods Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and "high" and "anxiety" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed.
   Results Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed.
   Conclusions Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function.

AB The medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive tests designed to help diagnose the disease must detect dysfunction in this system, but must also be insensitive to the cognitive slowing that characterizes normal ageing. On the assumption that the MTL system forms new memories by binding together the many informational aspects! of events into units, The Placing Test was designed to index this function by measuring the ability to remember associations between faces and their locations. The influence of normal ageing was minimized by using procedures that compensate for the difficulties in learning and retrieval caused by the cognitive slowing of normal ageing. In two experiments The Placing Test was administered as part of a battery of neuropsychological tests to a group of healthy older people. In both studies, performance in The Placing Test correlated significantly with other measures of memory, but had weaker associations than standard memory measures with other types of cognitive function. The Placing Test appeared not to be biased by age, education or gender, although a larger sample is needed to verify this. A final study examined the performance of 16 patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease. These patients showed clear impairment in The Placing Test, with 81% scoring below the 5th percentile, despite the majority having normal MMSE scores. It is concluded that The Placing Test provides a quick, simple and sensitive measure of memory that has potential to be useful in routine diagnostic investigations for Alzheimer's disease.

AB Background: Among elderly people without dementia, the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (APOE4) has been associated with cognitive deficit, particularly in episodic memory, but few reports are available on whether this association differs by sex.
   Methods: In a community-dwelling Norwegian cohort of 2181 elderly people (55% women), aged 70 74 years, episodic memory was examined in relation to sex and APOE4 zygosity, with the Kendrick Object Learning Test (KOLT).
   Results: Possession of at least one APOE4 allele had a modest, detrimental effect on episodic memory in women, whereas in men, heterozygotes were unaffected and homozygotes had markedly lower scores across the distribution of KOLT scores. This sex difference was found consistently in all analyses: on comparing means and medians, examining trends across quintiles, and studying the distribution of scores and the risk of cognitive impairment. Results were broadly similar when adjusted for known determinants of cognition and also when severely impaired participants were excluded. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of cognitive impairment in women was shown to be 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 2.8) for heterozygotes and 1.1 (0.3 to 3.7) for homozygotes; the adjusted OR in men was observed to be 1.1 (0.6 to 2.1) for heterozygotes and 10.7 (4.7 to 24) for homozygotes.
   Conclusions: Although the harmful effect of APOE4 on episodic memory was modest in women, the risk was found to occur in about 30%. APOE4 was observed to have a dramatic effect on episodic memory in men, but only in homozygotes, who comprised about 3% of men: the whole male homozygous group showed a marked shift to lower memory scores.

AB Research investigating the effects of sex on the lateralization of language functions has produced mixed results to date, with some studies finding sex differences and others not (Shaywitz, B.A., Shaywitz, S.E., Pugh, K.R., Constable, R.T., Skudlarski, P., Fulbright, R.K., Bronen, R.A., Fletcher, J.M., Shankweiler, D.P., Katz, L., et al., 1995.

Language processing is strongly left lateralized in both sexes. Evidence from functional MRI. Brain 122 (Pt. 2) 199-208). Further, few studies have evaluated how any such sex effects extend to tasks involving cognitive functions that may utilize language processes such as working and episodic memory. This study examined sex difference in material-sensitive functional activation (using fMRI) in working memory and episodic memory that included either words and faces. We performed these analyses on two large groups of healthy subjects with the goal of attempting to replicate results across two independent data sets. The results indicated that both males and females showed strong and consistent evidence for material-sensitive lateralization for both working and episodic memory, such that word tasks resulted in greater left-sided activation and face tasks resulted in greater right-sided activation. Further, few of the sex differences in regions showing material specificity effects in at least one gender replicated across studies, providing little evidence for any differences in lateralization patterns between the sexes. In conclusion, our data suggest that males and females show a similar pattern of lateralized activation to material type during working memory and recognition tasks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sex differences in executive speech tasks, favoring women, have been noted in behavioral studies and functional imaging studies. In the present study, the clustering and switching components of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests were examined in 40 healthy men and 40 healthy women. Possible sex differences in the influence of cognitive factors such as speed of information processing, word knowledge, and/or verbal long-term memory on these verbal fluency factors were also assessed. The results showed that women switched more often between categories in the phonemic fluency test, whereas men showed a trend toward a larger cluster size leading to a smaller total number of words generated. Additionally, higher performance on the Digit Symbol test was associated with better performance on the semantic and phonemic verbal fluency test in men, whereas in women, better memory performance was associated with better performance on these verbal fluency tests. Our data indicate that men and women are using different processing strategies for phonemic verbal fluency tests to optimize verbal fluency task performance. In the current study, women adopted a more successful strategy of balancing clustering and switching in the phonemic fluency task.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the role of regional cortical thickness in recall of verbal material over an extended time period. MRI scans of healthy adults of varying ages were obtained. Two scans were averaged per person to achieve high spatial resolution, and a semi-automated method for continuous measurement of thickness across the entire cortical mantle was employed. Verbal memory tests assessing recall after 5 min, 30 min, and a mean interval of 83 days were administered. A general linear model (GLM) of the effects of thickness at each vertex on the different memory indices was computed, controlling for gender, age, IQ, and intracranial volume. These analyses were repeated with hippocampal volume as an additional variable to be controlled for, to assess to which extent effects of cortical thickness were independent of hippocampal size. Minute effects of cortical thickness were observed with regard to shorter time intervals (5 and 30 min). However, even when controlling for the effects of hippocampal volume, higher recall across months was associated with thicker cortex of distinct areas including parts of the gyros rectus, the middle frontal gyros, the paricto-occipital sulcus and the lingual gyrus of both hemispheres. In addition, hemisphere-specific associations were found in parts of the right temporal and parietal lobe as well as parts of the left precuneus. This supports a unique and critical role of the thickness of distinct cortical areas in recall after months, more than after minutes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Much research on cognitive competence in normal older adults has documented age and sex differences. The authors used new cross-sectional data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS) (n = 386; age 61 to 95 years) to examine how health and biological age influence age and sex differences in cognitive aging. The authors found evidence for both moderating and mediating influences. Age differences were moderated by health status, such that the negative effects of age were most pronounced among participants of relatively better health. Sex differences were moderated by health and were more pronounced among participants reporting comparatively poorer health. Although health mediated a notable amount of age-related cognitive variation, BioAge mediated considerably more variance, even after statistical control for differences in health. A complex pattern emerged for the mediation of sex differences: Although BioAge accounted for sex-related variation in cognitive performance, health operated to suppress these differences. Overall, both health and BioAge predicted cognitive variation independently of chronological age.

AB Subjects with schizophrenia have cognitive alterations. The functional consequences of these deficits need to be fully determined, in order to implement more effective rehabilitation programs for patients with schizophrenia. This research explores the relationships between cognitive functioning and social problem-solving skills in a group of 20 chronic schizophrenic patients compared with those found in a group of 20 healthy subjects. The following cognitive domains were evaluated: verbal memory (Rey Auditory-Verbal Test; RAVLT), visuo-spatial organization and visuo-spatial memory (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test; RF), executive functioning (semantic verbal fluency test; VF, design fluency task; DF and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; WCST), attention (d 2 cancellation test) and general intellectual ability (Standard Progressive Matrices of Raven; SPM). Social problem-solving skills were assessed with a video-based test; the Assessment of Interpersonal Problem-Solving Skills (AIPSS). As a group, patients performed significantly worse than control subjects on every cognitive variable and on ATPSS receiving, processing and sending constructs. Among schizophrenic patients, correlations between AIPSS constructs and neuropsychological tests were observed for VF, DF, d2 and SPM whilst these associations were not replicated in healthy subjects. However, in the whole sample, after adjusting for age, gender and education, SPM displayed significant associations with all three AIPSS constructs. Moreover, after taking SPM into account, neither diagnostic groups (patients versus control) nor cognitive variables, except d2, provided an additional contribution to AIPSS performance. Cognitive impaired performances, mainly frontal, have a deleterious effect on social problem-solving skills in the schizophrenic group. It is suggested that alterations in social problem-solving skills may reflect social anxiety and/or "theory of mind" impairment. These factors may explain the lack of association among healthy subjects. The results support the inclusion of cognitive remediation programs designed to enhance social skills for patients where a cognitive deficit is clearly ascertained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Performance on neuropsychological tests is affected by age and education, which makes the early detection of cognitive impairment difficult when assessing individuals of varying levels of education. We examined the effects of age, education, and gender on three memory indexes of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, Delayed Memory, Working Memory and the difference between Working-Delayed Memory in a sample of patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, patients with mild probable Alzheimer's disease, and a nondemented elderly comparison group. Whereas Delayed and Working Memory scores were affected by participant type, age, and education, the Working-Delayed Memory difference score was affected by participant type, only. Our preliminary conclusions, pending replication of the findings with a larger sample, are that working-delayed memory difference was sensitive to early memory decline without being affected by age and education.

AB Earlier studies on adults have shown sex differences in face recognition. Women tend to recognise more faces of other women than men do, whereas there are no sex differences with regard to male faces. In order to test the generality of earlier findings and to examine potential reasons for the observed pattern of sex differences, two groups of Swedish 9-year-old children (n = 101 and n = 96) viewed faces of either Swedish or Bangladeshi children and adults for later recognition. Results showed that girls outperformed boys in recognition of female faces, irrespective of ethnicity and age of the faces. Boys and girls recognised Swedish male faces to an equal extent, whereas girls recognised more Bangladeshi male faces than boys did. These results indicate that three factors explain the magnitude of sex differences in face recognition: an overall female superior face recognition ability, the correspondence between the sex of viewer and the gender of the face, and prior knowledge of the ethnicity of the face.

AB Gender-related differences in brain activation patterns and their lateralization associated with cognitive functions have been reported in the field of language, emotion, and working memory. Differences have been hypothesized to be due to different cognitive strategies. The aim of the present study was to test whether lateralization of brain activation in the hippocampi during memory processing differs between the sexes. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy female and male study participants performing a spatial memory task and quantitatively assessed the lateralization of hippocampal activation in each participant. Hippocampal activation was significantly more left lateralized in women, and more right lateralized in men. Correspondingly, women rated their strategy as being more verbal than men did.

AB Women recall the appearance of others better than men. The goal of the present research was to shed light on the explanations and boundary conditions of this gender difference. In three studies (592 participants), the authors tested potential mediators and moderators of the gender difference. Results corroborated the robustness of the gender difference. General task motivation, general memory ability, importance of appearance, appearance knowledge, attention paid to target, gazing at target, and communal or agentic orientation could not explain why women were better at recalling others' appearance than men were. Except for importance of appearance and appearance knowledge, which both decreased the magnitude of the gender difference, general task motivation, attention paid to target, Length of exposure to target, delay in responding, cognitive load, and response format (verbal vs. nonverbal) had no effect on the gender difference. Results are discussed in relation to gender differences found in the nonverbal sensitivity literature.

AB Background: There is mounting evidence that declarative memory processes are impaired in patients with bipolar disorder. However, predictors of the observed impairment are not well understood. This study seeks to: (i) better characterize the nature of declarative memory impairment in bipolar disorder, and (ii) determine the relationship between clinical variables and memory function in bipolar disorder.
   Methods: 49 adult patients with bipolar disorder in varying mood states and 38 demographically matched healthy participants completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery assessing general cognitive functioning, processing speed, and declarative memory. The California verbal learning test was used to characterize learning and memory functions.
   Results: Although patients with bipolar disorder utilized a similar semantic clustering strategy to healthy controls, they recalled and recognized significantly fewer words than controls, suggesting impaired encoding of verbal information. In contrast, lack of rapid forgetting suggests relative absence of a storage deficit in bipolar patients. While severity of mood symptomatology and illness duration were not associated with task performance, gender and family history significantly affected memory function.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that declarative memory impairments in bipolar patients: (1) are consistent with deficits in learning, but do not appear to be related to different organizational strategies during learning, and (2) do not appear to be secondary to clinical state, but rather may be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of the illness.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether men and women with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) demonstrate differences in neuropsychological functioning compared to healthy men and women. Participants were 56 consecutive patients (33 male, 23 female) and 40 healthy control participants (20 male, 20 female) of comparable characteristics. Male and female patients had comparable symptom severity, illness duration, comorbidity, in- or outpatient status, and medication usage. An. extensive neuropsychological test battery was administered including tests of general nonverbal intelligence, attention, verbal and nonverbal memory, and executive functions. Male and female OCD patients showed comparable neuropsychological performances on most cognitive domains. However, we found some evidence for cross-sex shifts in verbal fluency tasks (FAS and Category Alternation Test [CAT]), the reading component of the Stroop test, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Span-Forward test. Post hoc analyses revealed that female patients showed reduced performance on these tests compared to healthy women, in the male-typical direction. Among OCD women only, there were,significant negative correlations between OCD symptom severity and performance on the CAT and the reading Stroop. We conclude that sex does not seem to be a major determinant of neuropsychological function in OCD, but the observed cross-sex shifts on some tasks deserve further examination.

AB Our main aim in this study was to explore the association between selective mutism (SM) and aspects of nonverbal cognition such as visual memory span and visual memory. Auditory-verbal memory span was also examined. The etiology of SM is unclear, and it probably represents a heterogeneous condition. SM is associated with, language impairment, but nonspecific neurodevelopmental factors, including motor problems, are also reported in SM without language impairment. Furtbermore, SM is described in Asperger's syndrome. Studies on nonverbal cognition in SM thus merit further investigation. Neuropsycbological tests were administered to a clinical sample of 32 children and adolescents with SM (ages 6-17 years, 14 boys and 18 girls) and 62 nonreferred controls matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We used independent t-tests to compare groups with regard to auditory-verbal memory span, visual memory span, and visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test), and employed linear regression analysis to study the impact of SM on visual memory, controlling for IQ and measures of language and motor function. The SM group differed from controls on auditory-verbal memory span but not on visual memory span. Controlled for IQ, language, and motor function, the SM group did not differ from controls on visual memory. Motor function was the strongest predictor of visual memory performance. SM does not appear to be associated with, deficits in visual memory span or visual memory. The reduced auditory-verbal memory span supports the association between SM and language impairment. More comprehensive neuropsychological studies are needed.

ID VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FEMALE ADVANTAGE;
   SUPPORT; WOMEN
AB Previously it has been, reported that female performance on the recall of objects and their locations in a spatial array is superior to that of males. This may reflect underlying information-processing biases whereby males organize information in a self-referential manner while females adopt a more comprehensive approach. The known female advantage in verbal memory may, however, account for this sex difference. In an initial experiment we found no overall sex differences in object or object-location memory. The inclusion of a verbal distracter task revealed gender-congruent biases in performance. A final study examined some methodological issues associated with the design of item arrays. After controlling for differences in item distinctiveness, performance on object-location was found to be substantially influenced by the distance that items were displaced in the array. These findings demonstrate that certain methodological factors can significantly affect the attentional and mnemonic processes that operate when performing tasks of this nature and can negate underlying sex differences in performance.

AB The aging, non-demented brain undergoes several physiological changes, some of which may affect cognitive function. The goal of the present study was to examine the associations between subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperimensities (WMHs), cortical and subcortical atrophy, and cognitive function (episodic memory, word fluency, attention, and perceptual, cognitive, and motor speed). This was done within a European collaborative study, Cardiovascular Determinants of Dementia (CASCADE), in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on community-dwelling individuals. The study includes 1254 persons from eight European study centers, ranging between 64 and 76 years of age (M 69.4 +/- 3.3; 55% men). When demographics (age, education, and sex), study center, and concurrent brain changes had been adjusted for, periventricular WMHS predicted lower performance in word fluency and the Stroop test (time), and subcortical atrophy predicted lower performance in motor speed and the Stroop test (errors). The findings are consistent with findings from lesion and functional neuroimaging studies. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Subjects were 228 females and 275 males, 8.0 to 11.9 years of age, in grades 2 through 4, who participated in a dental study. Performance on all tests improved with increasing age. Females performed better in rote verbal learning, psychomotor speed, and speed of information processing. Males had higher scores on tests of visual learning, visual memory, and fine motor speed and coordination. Nonverbal IQ had a significant impact on all tests except motor speed and coordination. Results represent an initial attempt to evaluate Portuguese children in educational and medical settings.

AB The relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 and change in cognition was examined in older men (n = 247; age = 75.0 +/- 3.5 years) and women (n = 79; age = 70.8 +/- 4.9 years) free of history of stroke. Participants were examined again 4.0 +/- 0.5 years later. Exclusion criteria were (1) initial scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination of 23 or less or (2) the presence of the APOE 2 / 4 genotype. Men with epsilon 4 showed greater decline in some measures of executive function and verbal memory compared to those without epsilon 4; women with 64 showed greater decline in Trail Making test performance relative to women without the allele. A significant gender x APOE epsilon 4 interaction was seen for change in performance on short delay cued recall. These results suggest that APOE epsilon 4 is associated with cognitive decline differently in older adult men and women.

AB In three experiments, location memory for faces was examined using a computer version of the matching game Concentration. Findings suggested that physical attractiveness led to more efficient matching for female faces but not for male faces. Study 3 revealed this interaction despite allowing participants to initially see, attend to, and match the attractive male faces in the first few turns. Analysis of matching errors suggested that, compared to other targets, attractive women were less confusable with one another. Results are discussed in terms of the different functions that attractiveness serves for men and women.

AB DISC1 is expressed in the hippocampus and has been identified as a possible genetic risk factor for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These psychiatric illnesses are associated with impaired learning and memory. This study investigates the association of variation in DISC1 with cognitive function on the same general mental ability test (Moray House Test) at age 11 and age 79, and cognitive change between ages 11 and 79, in 425 people from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921). Tests of memory, non-verbal reasoning and executive function were also administered at age 79. The effect of genotype at a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 11, rs821616, was studied. There was no direct effect of DISC1 genotype on any cognitive measure. However, there was a significant DISC1 genotype by sex interaction on Moray House Test scores at age 79, both before and after adjustment for cognitive ability at age 11 (p=0.034 and 0.043, respectively). Women homozygous for the Cys allele had significantly lower cognitive ability scores than men at age 79, p=0.003. Variation in DISC1 may therefore affect cognitive aging especially in women.

AB Objective: Baseline data are reported from a study of the effects of zinc supplementation on cognitive function in older adults as assessed by the CANTAB computerised test battery.
   Design: This is a multicentre prospective intervention study employing a randomised double-blind design.
   Setting: European community-based study.
   Participants: There are 387 healthy adults aged 55-87 y from centres in France, Italy and Northern Ireland.
   Interventions: Measures of visual memory, working memory and attention were obtained at baseline (prior to supplementation).
   Results: Younger adults (< 70 y) performed significantly better than older adults (> 70 y) on all tests, with minimal differences between centres. In addition, men outperformed women on tests of spatial span, pattern recognition memory and reaction times, although these gender differences varied somewhat between centres.
   Conclusions: The results are generally consistent with previous age- and gender-related effects on cognitive functioning.

AB In this preliminary study we investigate gender differences in object location memory. Our purpose is to extend the results about object location memory obtained in laboratory settings to a real 3-D environment and to further distinguish the specific components involved in this kind of memory by considering the strategies adopted to perform the task. To do this, we join the three-level model of spatial representations (landmark, route, and survey) proposed by Siegel and White (1975) with the three subcomponents of spatial memory (what, where, and what + where) identified by Postma and De Haan (1996). We adopted the object relocation task devised by Postma and De Haan (1996), adapted to a real environment. Seven common objects were placed on the floor of a cylindrical room. Sixty-four males and 64 females were asked to memorize the spatial layout. Next, the experimenter moved the objects to a different position along with seven new objects and the participants had to relocate the original objects to their initial positions. In line with Postma, Izendoorn, and De Haan (1998), we found no gender difference in object recognition, and in recalling absolute distance and categorical spatial relations; however males were better than females in recalling the distance between objects and the size of the layout. Overall, the data show a male advantage in some components of spatial cognition closely linked to the encoding of the metric structure of the spatial relationships at both route and survey level.

AB Rationale: There are clear sex differences in the onset and course of cocaine addiction, females being at greater risk. Neurocognitive impairments associated with cocaine use are also well documented. However, there are no studies of sex differences in neurocognitive performance among cocaine users. Objectives: The present study was designed to examine, for the first time, putative sex-related variations in cognition among recreational cocaine users. It was predicted that female users would perform poorer compared with male users based on the worse effects of cocaine abuse in women. Methods: A neuropsychological battery was administered to abstinent (72 h) recreational cocaine users (20 males and 20 females) and non-drug-using controls (19 males and 20 females) including tests of attention, executive functioning, verbal fluency (letter and category), verbal memory and visuospatial perception. Results: Male users demonstrated poorer attention compared with male controls, and greater verbal recognition errors than male controls and female users. Female users did not differ significantly in any other cognitive domain compared with male users or female controls. These results remained after controlling for dose-dependent variables. General dose-dependent effects were found for attention, visuospatial perception and components of verbal memory. Conclusions: Whilst these data partially support the notion of sex-related neurocognitive variation in short-term abstinence from recreational cocaine use, they do not suggest that sex is a major factor.

AB This study investigated sex differences in spatial memory using a human analogue of the Radial Arm Maze: a revision on the Nine Box Maze originally developed by Abrahams, Pickering, Polkey, and Morris (1997) called the 17-Box Maze Test herein. The task encourages allocentric spatial processing, dissociates object from spatial memory, and incorporates a within-participants design to provide measures of location and object, working and reference memory. Healthy adult males and females (26 per group) were administered the 17-Box Maze Test, as well as mental rotation and a verbal IQ test. Females made significantly fewer errors on this task than males. However, post hoc analysis revealed that the significant sex difference was specific to object, rather than location, memory measures. These were medium to large effect sizes. The findings raise the issue of task- and component-specific sexual dimorphism in cognitive mapping. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Norms for African American elders on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) were derived from a sample of 309 community-dwelling individuals participating in Mayo's Older African Americans Normative Studies (MOAANS). Normative estimates are provided for traditional WMS-R subtest scores and for supplemental procedures to evaluate forgetting rates and recognition memory. Tables are provided to convert raw WMS-R subtest and supplemental scores to age-corrected scaled scores. These may be further adjusted for years of education, if desired, by applying regression-based corrections. We anticipate that these data will enhance the diagnostic utility and clinical interpretation of WMS-R performance in older African Americans.

AB Auditory response profiles for a group of ten healthy young and ten healthy elderly subjects, evoked by implicit memory and delayed verbal recognition tasks, were evaluated to determine if effects of stimulus repetition could be identified in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and prefrontal cortical regions. We hypothesized that effects of stimulus repetition should occur both early in time and at early levels of the nervous system (STG) followed by later effects in prefrontal regions. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses were recorded using a whole-head MEG system and automated, multi-start analysis methods were applied to the data in order to characterize the temporal response profiles from distributed but focal, cortical regions engaged in memory-related tasks. The findings revealed a main effect of age for early activity (similar to 50 ms) in STG which appeared to be nonspecific for Old/New words and an Age x Task interaction for late activity (similar to 100-800 ms) in STG which was specific to Old/New words. Although the behavioral performance measures did not reveal traditional effects of response priming, the MEG measures did reveal a reduction in amplitude with stimulus repetition in young subjects. The elderly did not reveal a reduction in amplitude concomitant with stimulus repetition for either the global attributes of words or for specific Old/New words. Long duration effects of stimulus repetition noted in the present study raise the possibility that results from sensory gating, mismatch negativity and P300 paradigms may represent a continuum of stimulus repetition effects. Two of these paradigms evoke greater enhancement to novel or infrequent stimuli, or rather, greater reduction of amplitude with repetition. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It remains unclear whether smaller hippocampal volume is a consistent feature of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and whether it accounts for the associated memory deficits observed in this illness. Hippocampal volume, comparison regions and memory performance were examined in Holocaust survivors with PTSD (PTSD+: n=14; 5 men, 9 women) and without PTSD (PTSD-: it = 13; 6 men, 7 women) and a non-exposed control group of healthy Jewish adults (n = 20; 13 men, 7 women). The subjects had medical examinations, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and memory testing. PTSD+ subjects had poorer memory performance than non-exposed subjects and PTSD- subjects, but they did not differ from either group in right or left hippocampal volume when gender and head size were taken into account. Older age and smaller left hippocampal volume were more strongly associated in the PTSD+ group than in the PTSD- groups. Holocaust survivors had larger superior temporal gyral and lateral temporal lobe volumes bilaterally than non-exposed subjects. Smaller hippocatnpal volume is not invariably associated with chronic PTSD and does not explain the substantial explicit memory impairment observed in Holocaust survivors with this disorder. Larger temporal lobe volumes may be associated with early traumatization and survival or may reflect some other characteristic of Holocaust survivors. (c) \Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives: To establish the frequency of cognitive impairment in a population based sample of patients with recently diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and to determine the relation between cognitive abnormalities and the extent of macroscopic and microscopic tissue damage revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetisation transfer (MT) imaging.
   Methods: 58 patients with RRMS consecutively diagnosed in the previous six months in Aquitaine and 70 healthy controls underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. Lesion load and atrophy indices (brain parenchymal fraction and ventricular fraction) were measured on brain MRI. MT ratio (MTR) histograms were obtained from lesions, normal appearing white matter (NAWM), and normal appearing grey matter (NAGM). Gadolinium enhanced lesions were counted.
   Results:44 RRMS patients could be individually matched with healthy controls for age, sex, and education. Patients performed worse in tests of verbal and spatial memory, attention, information processing speed, inhibition, and conceptualisation. Measures of attention and information processing speed were correlated with lesion load, mean NAWM MTR, and the peak location of the NAGM MTR histogram in the patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that lesion load and mean NAWM MTR were among the MR indices that were most significantly associated with impairment of attention and information processing speed in these early RRMS cases.
   Conclusions: Cognitive impairment appears to be common in the early stages of RRMS, mainly affecting attention, information processing speed, memory, inhibition, and conceptualisation. The severity of these deficits reflects the extent of the lesions and the severity of tissue disorganisation outside lesions.

AB In our current study, we applied whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a subsequent memory paradigm. Magnetic fields were recorded while 20 healthy subjects (10 females, 10 males) incidentally encoded words during semantic and structural verbal processing tasks. Physiological data were then sorted according to the performance in subsequent memory tests and according to levels of processing, respectively, and analyzed for gender effects. Behavioral results show a clear advantage of semantic processing over structural processing with respect to retrieval success for both females and males. Despite alikeness of behavioral data, MEG results show considerable differences between males and females concerning both subsequent memory effects and levels of processing effects. For male subjects, we identified more distinct magnetic fields in anterior regions for subsequently remembered than for subsequently forgotten words (latency range from 300-650 ms after word onset) and for semantic processing than for structural processing, respectively. For female subjects, corresponding magnetic field differences pointed to posterior regions (subsequent memory effects from 450 ms to 750 ms after word onset). No qualitative differences were observed between subsequent memory effects during semantic processing compared to subsequent memory effects during structural processing. We try to reconcile results from male data with previous findings concerning subsequent memory effects by proposing the concept of width of processing, which holds that incidental memory formation is mediated by frontal activity on a physiological level and brought forward on a cognitive level by enhanced associating imposed by the task demands of semantic processing. Female data cannot be fully incorporated in this framework, but all the more prompt further gender-specific analyses of subsequent memory effects. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Using the criteria defined by Hasher and Zacks [Hasher, L., & Zacks, R. T. (1979). Automatic and effortful processes in memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 108(3), 356388], three studies examined the effects of intent of memorization, dual task interference, old age, practice and individual differences on memory for egocentric positions. Results showed that dual task interference and old age slightly influenced memory for egocentric positions. Small but significant individual differences were also observed. However, intent of memorization and practice had no influence on accuracy. The findings demonstrate that encoding of egocentric space works rather automatically but nevertheless requires minimal attentional resources. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Gender schema theories predict a memory bias toward sex-congruent information. The present study examined how presentation of stimuli and encoding conditions influence gender schematic processing in children and adults. One hundred and sixty 5- to 13-year olds and adult males and females viewed 36 sex-stereotyped toy pictures that were presented in a static and dynamical way. Half of the participants were asked to memorize the pictures (intentional memory) and half were not told that they would be expected to later recall the pictures (incidental memory). Weak gender schematic processing was observed only during the incidental memory task. Children and adults recalled more static than dynamic gender-stereotyped pictures, and performance was superior in the intentional than in the incidental memory condition. Gender schematic processing was similar across the age groups. In addition, participants were more likely to recall male-stereotyped toys. Implications for gender schema theories and education are discussed. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study investigated gender differences on memory processing using event-related potentials (ERPs). Behavioral data and ERPs were recorded in 16 males and 10 females during a recognition memory task for faces. The behavioral data results showed that females performed better than males. Gender differences on ERPs were evidenced over anterior locations and involve the modulation of two spatially and temporally distinct components. These results are in general accordance with the view that males and females differ in the cognitive strategies they use to process information. Specifically, they could differ in their abilities to maintain information over interference and in the processing of the intrinsic contextual attributes of items, respectively, associated with the modulation of two anterior components. These interpretations lend support to the view that processing in females entails more detailed elaboration of information content than in males. Processing in males is more likely driven by schemas or overall information theme. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although the male advantage in traditional spatial abilities is well established, the female advantage in object location memory remains tentative. Object location memory is the only spatial ability that yields a female advantage, leading some to speculate that other factors, such as verbal memory, may solely account for the sex difference. The present experiment directly addressed the role of verbal memory using a novel object location memory task. Results suggest that the direction of the sex difference is context-specific, depending on the nature of the stimuli, and that verbal memory may account for the female bias in object location memory.

AB It is not known whether, or to what degree, odor memory is influenced by lateralized brain processes. In this study, we administered a 12-item match-to-sample odor memory test separately to the left and right sides of the nose of 30 left- and 30 right-handed subjects of equivalent age, sex distribution, and overall general smell ability. For each test item, one of three delay intervals (10-, 30-, and 60-s) was interspersed between smelling the target stimulus and smelling the first of four response alternatives. Women, but not men, performed significantly better on the left than on the right side of the nose, conceivably reflecting greater reliance upon left-hemisphere semantic processes. Subjects who received the first test on the right side of the nose outperformed those who received the first test on the left side of the nose. As in previous work, an age-related decrement in odor memory test scores was present. These data contribute to the debate on the role of lateralized brain processes in episodic odor memory, and suggest that performance on a standardized match-to-sample odor memory task is influenced by a number of interacting factors.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of acquired disability during childhood. While much is now known about outcome following TBI in the school-aged population, recovery in infants and young children is less well documented. The aim of this study was to examine neurobehavioural function following TBI during early childhood, to plot recovery over the 30 months post-injury and to identify predictors of outcome. The study compared three groups of children, sustaining injuries of different severity (mild = 14, moderate = 46, severe = 24), aged 2.0-6.11 years at injury, with a healthy control group (n = 33). The groups were similar with respect to pre-injury adaptive and behavioural function, psychosocial characteristics, age and gender. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, intellectual, language and memory functions were investigated acutely post-injury and again at 12 and 30 months post-injury. Results suggested a strong association between injury severity across all neurobehavioural domains. Further, 30 month outcome was predicted by multiple factors including injury severity, socio-economic status, pre-injury adaptive abilities and age, with pre-injury child behaviour and specific lesion characteristics playing surprisingly little role. In conclusion, children with more severe injuries, lower pre-injury adaptive abilities and lower socio-economic status are at greatest risk of long-term neurobehavioural impairment, even several years post-injury.

AB Normal aging can be associated with impairments in source memory (recollecting an event's context). This study examined the effects of aging on specific-source memory (e.g., remembering which of 4 people spoke a word) and partial-source memory (e.g., remembering the gender of the person who spoke the word). When young and older adults were matched in terms of old-new recognition, age-related deficits were observed on both specific- and partial-source recollection. When the groups were matched on partial-source performance, no disproportionate specific-source impairment was seen. The results suggest that aging does not differentially affect specific- versus partial-source memory.

AB Cognitive impairments such as memory deficits and sleep disturbances are common clinical features of schizophrenia. Since sleep plays an important role in consolidation of memory, we hypothesize, that there is an interrelationship between distinct alterations in sleep and memory performance in schizophrenia. We studied 17 patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic medication with amisulpride (age range 22-44 years; 7 women) and 17 healthy controls (matched for age, gender and educational level). Sleep was recorded and scored according to the standard criteria by Rechtschaffen and Kales. Immediately before polysomnography and the morning after we performed neuropsychological tasks including Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test and a test for recall of spatial location for testing aspects of declarative memory and a mirror tracing skill for procedural memory. In comparison to healthy controls, the patients showed a significant increase in sleep onset latency and a significant decrease in sleep efficiency and amount of slow wave sleep (SWS). Furthermore, the patients' performance in recall of the Rey-figure and of spatial location the next morning was significantly impaired. These impairments in the tests for visuospatial memory were positively correlated with reduction in the amount of SWS and in sleep efficiency. These results point to a functional interrelationship between regulation of SWS and performance in visuospatial memory in schizophrenia. If these results of our pilot study hold true, they will allow the development of innovative treatment strategies for neuropsychological deficits in patients with schizophrenia.

AB The main objectives in the present study were to examine meaningful irrelevant speech and road traffic noise effects on episodic and semantic memory, and to evaluate whether gender differences in memory performance interact with noise. A total of 96 subjects, aged 13-14 years (n= 16 boys and 16 girls in each of three groups), were randomly assigned to a silent or two noise conditions. Noise effects found were restricted to impairments from meaningful irrelevant speech on recognition and cued recall of a text in episodic memory and of word comprehension in semantic memory. The obtained noise effect suggests that the meaning of the speech were processed semantically by the pupils, which reduced their ability to comprehend a text that also involved processing of meaning. Meaningful irrelevant speech was also assumed to cause a poorer access to the knowledge base in semantic memory. Girls outperformed boys in episodic and semantic memory materials, but these differences did not interact with noise.

AB A previous publication presented normative data on neuropsychological tests stratified by age, gender, and education based on the Original Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. Many contemporary investigations include subject samples with higher levels of education, a factor known to affect cognitive performance. Secular change in education prompted the reexamination of norms in the children of the Original Cohort. The study population consisted of 853 men and 988 women from the Offspring Study, free of clinical neurological disease, who underwent a neuropsychological examination, which included tests given to their parents in 1974 to 1976 as well as additional newer tests to provide a more comprehensive battery. The Offspring population overall was more evenly distributed by gender and better educated. Their performance on cognitive tests was superior to that of the Original Cohort. Multivariable analyses revealed that more years of education explained only a part of the cohort differences. These findings suggest that continued surveillance of each generation is necessary to document the impact that unique social and economic variables have on cognitive function. Here, the authors provide updated normative data.

AB Here we examined potential interactive relations of hypertension and gender to cognitive function in 98 healthy, older adults (ages 55-83 years; 64% male; 92% White). After statistical adjustment for age and education, hypertensives performed significantly more poorly than normotensives on tests of motor speed and manual dexterity (p < 0.05). The adverse consequences of hypertension in older adults was more pronounced for female than male hypertensives on tests of delayed visual memory, visual attention and working memory, visuoconstructional ability, motor speed and manual dexterity for the non-dominant hand (p < 0.05); these are dimensions of performance for which female gender may be a relative disadvantage. The findings suggest the need to further examine subgroups that are vulnerable to the cognitive correlates of hypertension. The results also highlight the need for increased attention to blood pressure control in older adults for the preservation of cognitive function.

AB The first section of this paper describes methodology and major cognitive outcomes of the Canberra Longitudinal Study (CLS). This community study of 1045 Australians aged 70 years or over commenced in 1990. Participants were reassessed on three subsequent occasions. Its major themes were investigations of prevalence of dementia and depression, risk factors, inter-individual variability and instrument development. Over 60 papers arising from the study have been published.
   The second section of this paper describes the use of a Factor of Curves (FOC) latent growth model to examine the existence of a common factor responsible for age-related deterioration in cognitive and non-Cognitive processes. This analysis is a logical progression in a series of investigations using the Canberra Longitudinal Study into risk factors and correlates of cognitive change using structural equation modeling techniques. The FOC model is described and is used to explore the nature of an hypothesized common factor and to determine its relationship with age, gender, education, pre-morbid intelligence and to the ApoE crenotype. Latent growth models were developed for each of reaction time, Symbol Letter Modalities Test (SLMT). Grip strength, self-reported Sensory disability and memory from three waves of data. Second-order latent level slope factors were established based on the individual factor growth curve models. Although a common factor model could be fitted to the data, there is little support that it represents a single common cause.

AB In mammals, spatial sex differences may have coevolved with sex differences in the size of home ranges. This study first evaluated whether, in keeping with most mammals and traditional human (Homo sapiens) societies, home ranges are larger in male than in female Westerners. Second, it established whether navigation patterns are associated with a broader set of spatial abilities in men than in women. Results showed that current male home ranges surpass female home ranges. Ranging was also positively correlated with achievement in tests of mental rotation, surface development, and location memory among men only, whereas it was associated with embedded figures scores in both sexes. Overall, these findings substantiate the adaptive role of several spatial sex differences in humans.

AB Different tasks are often used to assess spatial memory in humans compared to nonhumans. In order to bridge this paradigmatic gap, we used a within-subject design to test 61 undergraduates on three spatial memory tasks. One of these tasks, the Vanderberg 3D mental rotation task, is classically used to assess spatial memory in humans. The other two tests are virtual analogues of two tasks used classically to assess spatial memory in rodents: the Morris water task and an eight-arm radial maze. We find that males perform significantly better than females on the mental rotation task and in finding a hidden platform in the virtual Morris water task. Moreover, during a probe trial, males spend significantly more distance of their swim in the training quadrant, but males and females do not differ in navigating to a visible platform. However, for the virtual eight-arm radial maze, there is no sex difference in working memory errors, reference memory errors, or distance to find the rewards. Surprisingly, an examination of the correlations among the three tasks indicates that only mental rotation ability and Morris water task probe trial performance correlate significantly among the three tasks (i.e. there are no significant correlations with traditional measures the tasks, e.g. time or distance to completion). Hence, the Morris water task and the eight-arm radial maze do not assess spatial memory in the same manner, and even after equating factors such as motivation, stress, and motor demands, there still are procedural demands of the tasks that reinforce differential strategy selection during spatial memory. This suggests that caution should be taken when utilizing these two tasks interchangeable as tests of spatial memory. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HYPERMNESIA
AB Undergraduate students (23 men and 23 women) provided memory performance estimates before and after each of three recall trials involving 80 stimuli (40 pictures and 40 words). No sex differences were found across trials for the total recall of items or for the recall of pictures and words separately. A significant increase in recall for pictures (not words) was found for both sexes across trials. The previous results of lonescu were replicated on the first and second recall trials: men underestimated their performance on the pictures and women underestimated their performance on the word items. These differences in postrecall estimates were not found after the third recall trial: men and women alike underestimated their performance on both the picture and word items. The disappearance of item-specific sex differences in postrecall estimates for the third recall trial does not imply that men and women become more accurate at estimating their actual performance with multiple recall trials.

AB Negative emotions (eg, tension, anxiety, fear, anger) influence acute pain recall. Given reliance on patient-provided pain reports across the care continuum, an understanding of factors that modulate pain memory processing become important to patients, clinicians, and health care organizations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of negative emotions on the prediction of 6-month pain recall by using an experimental stress manipulation (speech task) + pain (forehead cold pressor) versus nonstress control + pain crossover design (n = 68). Results showed that (1) negative emotions were greater in the stress session than the nonstress session, and experienced pain levels did not differ by condition or sex; (2) the level negative emotions at the time of the pain stimuli mediated the ability of experienced pain to predict pain recall; and (3) women recalled more stress session pain than men, and nonstress pain was accurately recalled. Integrating these findings with those of others, we present a model of acute pain memory recall in which negative emotions influence pain memory processing wherein the level of experienced pain predicts short-term recall and affective state at the time of the experience becomes a powerful predictor for the long-term recall of experienced pain level.
   Perspective: After 6 months the level of recalled experimental pain delivered within a stressful context becomes exagerated. Negative emotions at the time of the painful stimuli and at recall influenced the prediction of the level of recalled pain. Emotional arousal may influence how memory for pain is encoded, processed, and retrieved. (C) 2004 by the American Pain Society.

AB Five studies investigated gender differences in the accurate recall of the appearance of others. The greater interpersonal orientation and interpersonal sensitivity of women were predicted to give women an advantage over men in appearance accuracy. Under both directed- and incidental-learning conditions, women more accurately recalled information concerning the appearance of their social targets than did men, participants' memory for the appearance of female targets was more accurate than it was for male targets, and neither gender was found to be at a relative advantage in recalling the appearance of same-gender targets. The motivational and knowledge-based factors that might underlie a gender difference in appearance accuracy are discussed.

AB Objective: Screening of normal older persons for progressive memory decline is a worthwhile strategy in the pursuit of the earliest possible stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease ( AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Reliable tests are needed to both detect MCI and measure the natural history of decline over months rather than years. We aimed to detect memory decline over 1 year in a group of older individuals with well-characterised amnestic MCI. Methods: The continuous learning task (CLT) from the CogState test battery was administered 8 times in 12 months to 15 individuals with MCI and 35 controls matched for age, education, IQ and gender. All subjects were recruited from an ongoing aging study. The rate of change in CLT performance over the year was compared between groups and also compared to that detected with a word list learning task and a computerised paired associate learning task. Results: At baseline, memory performance in the amnestic MCI group was significantly worse than controls on all memory tests. However, at 12 months the magnitude of the difference between the groups had increased significantly on the CLT due to decline in memory accuracy in the MCI group. No decline over 12 months was detectable on the routine memory tests. Conclusions: Subtle memory decline is detectable in amnestic MCI using reliable and sensitive tests of memory. Such measures may assist in the early identification of AD and also in trials of putative disease-modifying therapies to be conducted over as little as 12 months. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

AB While the influences of such variables as age and sex are well established for most standardized tests of odor identification and detection, this is not the case for tests of odor memory. In this study, 231 non-smoking men and women, ranging in age from 10 to 68 years, were administered a standardized 12-item match-to-sample microencapsulated odor memory test (OMT). Anosmics were excluded from the study. Each participant was asked to smell a target odorant after its release from a microencapsulated odorant pad and then, after a delay interval of 10, 30 or 60 s, to pick the target from a similarly presented set of four odors, three of which were foils. Backward counting by threes was required during the delay intervals in an effort to minimize semantic rehearsal. Overall OMT scores were higher for women than for men, and decreased, in each sex, as a function of age in a manner similar to the age-related decline observed in tests of odor identification and detection. Performance did not change as a function of delay interval. A significant correlation between the overall OMT test scores and scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was observed for women, but not for men, in accord with the notion that women may be more likely to employ semantic cues in their strategies to remember odors. The findings are discussed in light of the complexities of the construct of odor memory.

AB Adolescent development involves progressive changes in brain structure and cognitive function, but relatively few studies have documented the cognitive correlates of differences in structural brain volumes in this age group. We examined the relations among age, cognitive processing, and mesial temporal lobe volume in 37 children and adolescents. Participants completed a brief cognitive assessment battery and underwent volumetric structural magnetic resonance imaging. For the sample as a whole, amygdala volume correlated positively with age, and larger volumes of both the left and right amygdala were significantly associated with better performance on several cognitive tasks assessing academic skills and acquired knowledge in long-term memory. In contrast, hippocampal volumes did not correlate with adolescents' age and were less frequently correlated with cognitive performance. Amygdala volumes were most predictive of cognitive abilities in boys, whereas for girls, the volume of the hippocampus contributed more frequently to the prediction of cognitive abilities. These data suggest that mensurable differences in mesial temporal volumes during adolescence are reliably associated with long-term cognitive abilities, particularly academic skills and the acquisition of intellectual knowledge, and that these relationships may differ as a function of the sex of the child.

AB Previous research has found gender differences in everyday memory tasks such as remembering shopping lists or directions, and these findings can be attributed to increased motivation or memory skill resulting from the association of different tasks with masculine or feminine gender roles. To investigate the motivational explanation, the recall of an ambiguous shopping list, labeled as grocery or hardware, was examined under instructions that stated that either women or men are good at the task, or instructions that were neutral. The findings were not consistent with the skill explanation. There was a significant interaction between list label, participant gender, and instructions, which can be explained in terms of the increased or decreased motivation that might arise from particular combinations of label and instruction.

AB Psychological studies have found better memory in women than men for emotional events, but the neural basis for this difference is unknown. We used event-related functional MRI to assess whether sex differences in memory for emotional stimuli is associated with activation of different neural systems in men and women. Brain activation in 12 men and 12 women was recorded while they rated their experience of emotional arousal in response to neutral and emotionally negative pictures. In a recognition memory test 3 weeks after scanning, highly emotional pictures were remembered best, and remembered better by women than by men. Men and women activated different neural circuits to encode stimuli effectively into memory even when the analysis was restricted to pictures rated equally arousing by both groups. Men activated significantly more structures than women in a network that included the right amygdala, whereas women activated significantly fewer structures in a network that included the left amygdala. Women had significantly more brain regions where activation correlated with both ongoing evaluation of emotional experience and with subsequent memory for the most emotionally arousing pictures. Greater overlap in brain regions sensitive to current emotion and contributing to subsequent memory may be a neural mechanism for emotions to enhance memory more powerfully in women than in men.

DT Article
ID NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; CULTURAL-BIAS
AB The assessment of verbal memory is a core component of neuropsychological assessment, and is often assessed through the use of list-learning tasks. As with other neuropsychological tests, list-learning tasks may be impacted by cultural relevance of test content. This study examined the extent to which the American content of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) impacts upon the verbal memory performance of New Zealanders. Participants included 90 healthy New Zealand adults who ranged in age from 17 to 81 years. Each participant completed the CVLT and a new version of this test that was modified to reflect New Zealand content (NZ-VLT). Performance on the two measures was not significantly impacted by gender, cultural identity (European/Pakeha; Maori or Pacific Islander), or version of the test administered first. Poorer performances on all scores for both measures were significantly related to increased age, with larger correlation coefficients produced for the New Zealand version of the task. Within-subject comparisons revealed that participants performed significantly better on the New Zealand version of the task for short-delay free recall, long-delay free recall, and recognition trials. Implications of these findings are presented to aid clinicians in future applications of the CVLT in New Zealand.

The current study examined the influence of demographic characteristics on HVLT-R performance measures in a community-dwelling sample of 237 African American older adults (60-84 years). Age, gender, and education accounted for moderate amounts of variance in HVLT-R performance. Based on these results, normative tables for HVLT-R scores, stratified by age and with score adjustments for education and gender, are provided.

AB We investigated sex difference across a number of olfactory tasks. Thirty-six men and 35 women ranging in age from 19 to 36 years were assessed in 6 different tasks: absolute sensitivity for n-butanol, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, episodic recognition memory for familiar and unfamiliar odors, and odor identification. No sex differences were observed in the tasks tapping primarily sensory acuity (i.e., odor sensitivity, intensity discrimination, and quality discrimination) or in episodic memory for unfamiliar odors. By contrast, women outperformed men in the tasks involving verbal processing (i.e., memory for familiar odors and odor identification), Interestingly, controlling for odor naming ability resulted in that the observed sex difference in episodic odor memory for familiar odors disappeared. This outcome suggests that women's superiority in episodic odor memory is largely mediated by their higher proficiency in odor identification.

AB Age and gender differences were examined using the new Spatial Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ) and the Misplaced Objects Test (MOT) for location recall. Analysis of the MOT scores revealed significant age differences with younger adults performing better than older adults. Women performed better than men did, but despite higher scores, the women showed consistently lower self-efficacy than the men. Analyses of the SSEQ measures revealed significant differences as a function of age and gender, with men showing greater spatial memory self-efficacy than women, and older adults showing less self-efficacy than younger adults. Analyses of congruence (accuracy of SSEQ responses relative to MOT scores) revealed that older adults and men tended to overestimate their ability to remember object locations. Explanations for these findings are based on self-efficacy theory, in particular, the possible influence of gender socialization on beliefs about ability.

Results from regression analyses controlling for the effects of age, gender, and education show that higher extraversion and lower neuroticism are associated with higher episodic memory performance. In addition, the strength of the correlations between neuroticism and episodic memory declined with increasing age in a male sub-sample, revealing an interaction between age and neuroticism.

AB A prominent hypothesis in cognitive aging is the existence of a common factor that is responsible for age-related deterioration in cognitive and noncognitive processes. A multiple indicators, multiple causes model was used to examine the nature of this common factor and its relationship to ape, gender, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, The common factor was modeled by using 10 indicator variables with 374 participants aged between 77.4 and 98.7 years. A latent factor was identified, with all indicators except blood pressure loading significantly. This factor could be established in 2 age strata within the sample. After controlling for the effects of gender, APOE, and level of education, direct effects of age were seen on visual functioning and grip strength. APOE was significantly associated with memory but not with the common factor. The findings suggest that a number of specific processes may operate concurrently with any common cause factor.

AB Many 'first generation' African Caribbean residents in the UK have now reached ages where risk of cognitive impairment and dementia starts to increase. In addition, conditions which may impair cognitive function, such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke, have high prevalence rates in African Caribbean populations. However, there is a lack of normative data for cognitive tests in this ethnic group. Cognitive assessment was carried out in a south London community population of 285 African Caribbean participants aged 55-75 years. Tests were drawn principally from the consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) battery (Boston Naming Test, verbal fluency, word list recall, and Trailmaking Tests A and B) and also included orientation items from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clock Drawing Test. Independent effects of age, sex, education and occupation were identified on scores for most but not all cognitive tests. Compared with normative data for African American populations, lower scores on verbal fluency and the Boston Naming Test were observed but scores on memory tests were comparable. Normative data for the tests are presented, stratified by level of education. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; PET IMAGES; BRAIN
AB We tested the possibility suggested by previous imaging studies that amygdala participation in the storage of emotionally influenced memory is differentially lateralized in men and women. Male and female subjects received two PET scans for regional cerebral glucose-one while viewing a series of emotionally provocative (negative) films, and a second while viewing a series of matched, but emotionally more neutral, films. Consistent with suggestions from several previously published studies, enhanced activity of the right, but not the left, amygdala in men was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films. Conversely, enhanced activity of the left, but not the right, amygdala in women was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films. These results demonstrate a clear gender-related lateralization of amygdala involvement in emotionally influenced memory, and indicate that theories of the neurobiology of emotionally influenced memory must begin to account for the influence of gender.

AB This study investigated factors associated with the commonly found own-race bias (ORB) in face recognition. We utilized several measures of general face-recognition memory, visual perception and memory, general cognitive functioning, racial attitudes, and cross-race experience in an attempt to distinguish those individuals more likely to demonstrate the effect. White respondents (N = 129) were presented two facial-recognition tests (immediate and delayed) involving Black and White faces of both genders. The resulting ORE stemmed largely from a bias to respond "seen before" to Black faces, and produced an effect that was reliable across a 2-day period. An own-sex bias in accuracy was also found. The Benton Facial Recognition test and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test, 2 central measures of visual memory, were related to ability to recognize White faces. Self-reported amount of recent cross-race experiences was also correlated with overall accuracy on Black and White faces.

AB The aim of this paper was to examine age-related changes and gender differences in memory self-evaluation in old people and to examine the predictive power of objective memory performance and of personality variables (neuroticism and extraversion) on memory self-evaluation. In a cross-sectional study, 301 not institutionalized people aged 65-94, 207 male and 94 female, were tested on three parameters. Subjective memory evaluation was operationalized with three one-item ratings: temporal comparison, social comparison, situation-specific memory self-evaluation just after performing a memory test. Objective memory assessment (free recall) used a computerized test. Personality assessment included the two main sub-scales 'extraversion' and 'neuroticism' from the Freiburger Personlichkeits-Inventar. The results shaved that persons of all age groups have a realistic appraisal of their age-related memory decline. No gender effects were found for any of the three forms of memory self-evaluation. The relationship between objective memory performance, personality variables and memory self-evaluation however depends on age and gender. Our results show that objective memory performance is predictive for memory self-evaluation in men aged >75 years, whereas in men <75 neuroticism is the only significant predictor. Men of the older cohort seem to have adapted to the age-related memory decline whereas the young old are still coping with the ongoing changes. In women of both age groups the objective memory performance is the only and strong predictor of memory self-evaluation. Our results suggest that gender-specific educational socialization might be the reason for these differences.

AB Middle-aged (N = 252, M = 39.91), young-old (N = 486, M = 60.77), and old-old (N = 137, M = 74.42) participants in the Seattle Longitudinal Study were tested on two occasions on their recall of a 20-item word list. Proportions of participants in each group correctly recalling each word-unit served as the dependent measure. Word-unit scores obtained in 1991 were regressed on those from 1984, yielding linear functions that varied by age group. Each set of word-unit scores (three groups on two occasions) was then regressed on word familiarity, imageability, primacy, and recency. The relative influence of each of these variables on memorability was then compared, both between and within cohorts. Primacy and familiarity were consistently strong predictors. Imageability and recency were predictive of memorability in the middle-aged group, but less so in the young-old, and not at all in the old-old group. Results and possible implications are discussed.

AB The impact of verbal and visuospatial ability on sex differences in episodic memory was investigated. One hundred men and 100 women, 20-40 years old, participated in a series of verbal and visuospatial tasks. Episodic memory was assessed in tasks that, to a greater or lesser extent, were verbal or visuospatial in nature. Results showed that women excelled in verbal production tasks and that men performed at a superior level on a mental rotation task. In addition, women tended to perform at a higher level than men on most episodic memory tasks. Taken together, the results demonstrated that (a) women perform at a higher level than men on most verbal episodic memory tasks and on some episodic memory tasks with a visuospatial component, and (b) women's higher performance on episodic memory tasks cannot fully be explained by their superior performance on verbal production tasks.

AB This research examined two aspects of gender effects in eyewitness accounts: whether there are gender differences in memory for a violent crime and how gender of perpetrator/victim affect witnesses' evaluations of perpetrator/victim behavior. Eighty male and 84 female university students saw a film showing a simulated manslaughter with either a male or female perpetrator stabbing a male or female victim. A female advantage was found in overall memory of the crime, and both a male perpetrator and a male victim were assigned more culpability than their female counterparts. It is suggested that females may have more elaborated categories for person information than males, which should facilitate female accuracy in person memory. Alternatively, the present findings may reflect a more general female advantage in episodic memory performance. Stereotype assimilation is suggested to account for the differential evaluations of a male and female perpetrator/victim.

ID YOUNG CHILDRENS MEMORY; KNOWLEDGE; ATTENTION; TEXT; STRATEGIES;
   VARIABLES
AB Sixty preschoolers participated in two experimental sessions designed to measure their beliefs about the relations between effort, interest, and recall as well as their actual effort deployment and recall under different interest levels. In Session 1, children made paired-comparison judgments about the individual and combined effects of high versus low effort and high versus low interest on recall. In Session 2, the children's effort deployment (behavior during study), recall, and attributions for recall in high versus low interest conditions were examined. Findings from Session 1 indicated that the children believed that recall increases with effort and with interest. They also believed that interest influences the amount of effort expended during study such that high interest elicits high effort and leads to superior recall relative to a low interest-low effort combination. Findings from Session 2 indicated that these beliefs were quite naive; that is, interest level did influence the children's effort deployment during study but the effects were more complex than the children had predicted. Contrary to the children's beliefs, effort was not related to recall and recall was superior in the low- not the high-interest condition. Consistent sex differences in beliefs, behavior, and recall performance were found. Compared with boys, most girls held naive beliefs about effort and interest and this naivete was associated with strategic behavior and recall performance advantages. The findings are discussed in terms of the importance and limitations of preschoolers' beliefs about memory. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB The purpose of our study was to examine whether girls and boys show patterns of problem-solving ability similar to those attributed by Kimura in 1992 to women and men, respectively.  Subjects were 28 girls and 24 boys, aged 5-11 years, who were tested individually on matching ability, spatial memory, and ideational fluency, tasks on which women reportedly outperform men.  No significant gender differences in these problem-solving abilities were found.  On ideational fluency, the youngest girls were seven times more likely than young boys to give whimsical responses, but older girls were ten times less likely than older boys to give whimsical responses.  These results suggest that the patterns of visuospatial problem-solving abilities that Kimura ascribed to women and men are not present in preadolescent girls and boys.

LA English
DT Article
AB Recent magnetic resonance imaging data suggest that men show more rapid age-associated atrophy of the left hemisphere than do women. To investigate whether a similar pattern occurs for functional decline, the authors tested 417 male-female pairs, ages 17-79 years and matched perfectly on age and education, on 3 computer-simulated everyday verbal memory tests: Name-Face Association, First-Last Name Associate Learning, and Grocery List Selective Reminding. Age and gender significantly predicted performance on all 3 tests. By contrast, only 1 of 15 Age x Gender interactions was significant, accounting for merely 1% of the test variance. These data suggest that although gender-based differences in rate of left-hemisphere structural decline may occur with normal aging, these apparently do not translate into differential functional decline in simulated everyday verbal memory.

DT Article
ID MEMORY; RECOGNITION; RECALL
AB When processing gender-related information, children have difficulty remembering materials that are counterstereotypic or that are associated more strongly with the other sex. We investigated whether encoding difficulties account for these memory problems. Children (kindergarten through Grade 3) were shown pictures of men and women in traditional, nontraditional, or neutral roles. Some children were given stimulus labels at acquisition to simplify the encoding task. Free-recall data revealed biases in the direction of gender stereotypes, irrespective of label vs. no-label conditions (Studies 1 and 2) and of slower vs. faster presentation rates (Study 2). Results suggest that an inability to encode at acquisition is probably not the major cause of gender-related biases observed in later recall and have implications for the development of intervention programs designed to reduce gender-schematic processing.
