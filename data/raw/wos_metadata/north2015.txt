AB Income inequality undermines societies: The more inequality, the more health problems, social tensions, and the lower social mobility, trust, life expectancy. Given people's tendency to legitimate existing social arrangements, the stereotype content model (SCM) argues that ambivalence?perceiving many groups as either warm or competent, but not both?may help maintain socio-economic disparities. The association between stereotype ambivalence and income inequality in 37 cross-national samples from Europe, the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Africa investigates how groups' overall warmth-competence, status-competence, and competition-warmth correlations vary across societies, and whether these variations associate with income inequality (Gini index). More unequal societies report more ambivalent stereotypes, whereas more equal ones dislike competitive groups and do not necessarily respect them as competent. Unequal societies may need ambivalence for system stability: Income inequality compensates groups with partially positive social images.

ID ATTITUDES
AB We introduce a novel ageism scale, focusing on prescriptive beliefs concerning potential intergenerational tensions: active, envied resource succession, symbolic identity avoidance, and passive, shared-resource consumption (SIC). Four studies (2,010 total participants) were Used to develop the scale. Exploratory factor analysis formed an initial 20-item, 3-factor solution (Study 1). The scale converges appropriately with other prejudice measures and diverges from other social control measures (Study 2). It diverges from antiyouth ageism (Study 3). The Study 4 experiment yielded both predictive and divergent validity apropos another ageism measure. Structural equation modeling confirmed model fit across all studies. Per an intergenerational-tension focus, younger people consistently scored the highest. As generational equity issues intensify, the scale provides a contemporary tool for current and future ageism research.

AB This research assesses younger worker perceptions of older and same age worker stereotypes and communication in the USA and Thailand. Results indicate that older workers are generally seen by younger workers as more uncomfortable with new technology, less flexible and more cautious on the job, and more loyal (and having fewer absences) to the organization than younger workers. As compared to younger American workers, younger Thai workers agree more with negative stereotype items that older workers make more mental mistakes, are slower to adapt to new technology, are more fearful of technology, and are less flexible at work. But they also agree more with positive stereotype items that older workers are absent less, have a better attitude toward work, and have a higher level of commitment to the organization than younger workers. In terms of their communication, younger Thai workers perceive both other younger Thai workers and older Thai workers as exhibiting more avoidant communication than their counterparts from the USA. The younger Thai workers also perceive members of their own age in-group as communicating in a more nonaccommodating manner than younger American workers. Implications for the aging process across cultures and the workplace are discussed.

DE Ageism; Culture; Intergenerational interactions; Age segregation;
   Gerontological curriculum; One-child generation; Consumerism
AB It is often assumed that Chinese people tend to have a more positive attitude toward aging and old age than Americans, due to the cultural generalization of collectivism versus individualism. This study aimed to critically examine this assumption by using first-hand empirical data collected in a Chinese and an American university (standardized surveys and in-depth focus group interviews). Respectively, 980 college students in China and 332 college students in the U.S. were recruited for the standardized surveys; whereas two focus-group interviews in each country (4 participants per group) were conducted to collect more in-depth information. Contrary to the common assumption, this study revealed that Chinese students actually hold more negative attitudes toward aging and older people compared to their American peers. It was also found that females tend to hold more positive attitudes than male students across both cultures, though American female students hold more positive attitudes than Chinese female students. Chinese students' interactions with seniors are often limited to their grandparents whereas American students tend to reach out to non-grandparent seniors in larger communities. Chinese students' more negative attitudes toward aging and older people may be a result of a combination of educational, social, and economic factors-a higher level of age segregation (geographically, socially, and intellectually) and a lack of gerontological curriculum in Chinese educational system, the caregiving burden faced by the one-child generation compounded with lack of governmental support for caregiving, as well as the rising youth-oriented consumerist culture.

DT Article
ID MODERNIZATION; EDUCATION; PEOPLE; STATES; YOUNG
AB Knowledge about aging and the attitudes toward older people were surveyed in undergraduate students (total number of subjects sampled is 1402) in four countries (Japan, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam) in eastern cultures and in two countries (United States and United Kingdom) in western cultures. All participants completed two questionnaires, FAQ1 (for knowledge) and ASD (for attitudes) in their own languages. It was found that within the undergraduate students sampled: (a) the level of knowledge about aging in the western countries is significantly higher than that in the eastern countries, and (b) attitudes toward aging are more positive in the western countries compared to the eastern countries. The data suggest that, within the limits of the sampling: (a) the tradition of respecting older adults in eastern cultures may have weakened gradually, and (b) the modernization theory that assumes industrialization devalues aging populations appears to be supported in eastern countries but not in western countries. An alternative non-linear theory is discussed for the relationship between modernization and the societal views on aging. Educational promotion of knowledge about aging is emphasized for the formation of positive attitudes toward older adults.

AB Many studies conducted in the United States (U.S.) have documented a positivity effect in aging-a tendency for older adults to remember more positive than negative information in comparison to young adults. Despite this cognitive emotional benefit, U.S. adults still hold a more negative view of aging compared to adults in Asia. We hypothesized that these aging stereotypes may contribute to different patterns of age-related emotional memory processing in the two cultures. In the present study, we tested young and older adults in the U.S. and China on a View of Aging task and an emotional picture memory task. Chinese older adults hold a significantly more positive view of aging compared to all other groups of participants. Older adults in both countries demonstrated an age-related positivity effect, but Chinese older adults showed a trend in remembering fewer negative pictures than their American counterparts. These findings suggest that aging stereotypes might significantly influence older adults' cognitive abilities.

AB Introduction: Filial piety (FP) is a central theme in Asian culture and is seen as care for one's parents as part of a traditional concept of Confucianism. Older people may hold strong expectations for FP from their children. Attitudes towards the experience of ageing may be influenced by how far one perceives their expectations to be met. Method: A cross-sectional evaluation of expectation for FP and attitudes to ageing was undertaken in three different cultural groups-elderly Chinese immigrants living in the UK, Chinese older people living in Beijing and Scottish older people living in Scotland. Results: There were significant differences between the three cultural groups on a standardized measure of attitudes to ageing on psychosocial loss, F(2, 127) = 28.20, p = 0.0005 and physical change, F(2, 127) = 67.60, p = 0.0005 domains of attitudes to ageing. With expectations for FP, the UK-born participants evidenced lower expectations than the two Chinese groups, who were very similar in their levels of expectation, F(2, 127) = 10.92, p = 0.0005. Conclusions: The study was the first of its kind to consider attitudes to ageing and expectations for FP across three cultural groups. Overall an interesting pattern of results emerged suggesting that both Chinese groups remain invested in the concept of FP, whereas the UK sample was not. In contrast, however, the Chinese immigrants and the UK participants were more similar in reporting attitudes to ageing than the Chinese participants who were more likely to endorse a loss-deficit view of ageing.

AB College students (N = 3,435) in 26 cultures reported their perceptions of age-related changes in physical, cognitive, and socioemotional areas of functioning and rated societal views of aging within their culture. There was widespread cross-cultural consensus regarding the expected direction of aging trajectories with (a) perceived declines in societal views of aging, physical attractiveness, the ability to perform everyday tasks, and new learning; (b) perceived increases in wisdom, knowledge, and received respect; and (c) perceived stability in family authority and life satisfaction. Cross-cultural variations in aging perceptions were associated with culture-level indicators of population aging, education levels, values, and national character stereotypes. These associations were stronger for societal views on aging and perceptions of socioemotional changes than for perceptions of physical and cognitive changes. A consideration of culture-level variables also suggested that previously reported differences in aging perceptions between Asian and Western countries may be related to differences in population structure.

AB The stereotype content model (SCM) proposes potentially universal principles of societal stereotypes and their relation to social structure. Here, the SCM reveals theoretically grounded, cross-cultural, cross-groups similarities and one difference across 10 non-US nations. Seven European (individualist) and three East Asian (collectivist) nations (N = 1,028) support three hypothesized cross-cultural similarities: (a) perceived warmth and competence reliably differentiate societal group stereotypes; (b) many out-groups receive ambivalent stereotypes (high on one dimension; low on the other); and (c) high status groups stereotypically are competent, whereas competitive groups stereotypically lack warmth. Data uncover one consequential cross-cultural difference: (d) the more collectivist cultures do not locate reference groups (in-groups and societal prototype groups) in the most positive cluster (high-competence/high-warmth), unlike individualist cultures. This demonstrates out-group derogation without obvious reference-group favouritism. The SCM can serve as a pancultural tool for predicting group stereotypes from structural relations with other groups in society, and comparing across societies.

AB Young adults in Canada (N = 161) and South Korea (N = 165) rated either themselves or typical others at target ages 25, 45, and 65 years. In both countries, poorer memory was anticipated with each increase in age on all 3 memory belief factors: capacity, change, and locus. Both groups demonstrated a self-protective bias about age-related decline, with Koreans showing a greater effect. These findings demonstrate the cross-cultural generality of negative memory stereotypes of middle and old age and the importance of self-other distinctions in age biases.

TI Students' Attitudes Toward Older People: A Cross-Cultural Comparison
SO JOURNAL OF INTERGENERATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS
LA English
DT Article
DE cultural differences; attitudes toward older people; FSA
AB There is a popular belief that attitudes toward older people are predominantly negative in Western cultures and positive in Eastern cultures. In the light of social and cultural changes in these cultures, it is timely to investigate whether this belief still holds true. The study also explores an often-ignored feature of cultural differences in these attitudes, namely, that attitudes toward older people are mixed phenomena in both cultures. The study uses a cross-group research design. Sixty-five undergraduates (31 Western and 35 Eastern) completed the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) administered on computers. It found that attitudes toward older people were generally positive in both cultures and did not support the first hypothesis that attitudes toward older people would be predominantly negative in Western cultures and positive in Eastern cultures. However, as predicted, attitudes toward older people were mixed in both cultures. This study highlights the similarity in attitudes toward older people across cultures and argues that future studies need to be encouraged to pay more attention to positive attitudes.

AB Children from the People's Republic of China and from the United States were asked to judge younger and older adults. Children's impression and memory for these adults was examined, along with their ability to use information presented about the adults to judge them. How stable children thought traits were about an adult as that adult ages, and how well children recalled information that was consistent or inconsistent with age stereotypes, was also examined. Additionally, the relationship between children's experiences with older adults, and their views of older adults, was assessed. Although 10-year-old American children were more negative about older adults than other children, 6-and 10-year-old children in both the People's Republic of China and the United States expressed negative views of older adults. However, these negative views, or age stereotypes, were more readily found when the task required a comparison between younger and older adults, even when that comparison was for the same person as a younger and older person. Although children were more positive in their views of the adults following the presentation of positive information, children did not necessarily see these characteristics as being stable, especially if they ran counter to stereotype. This was particularly true for the 6-year-old children. These results are discussed in terms of the formation and counter-formation of age stereotypes in children. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press.

AB To test hypotheses about intra- and intergenerational communication perceptions, university students with work experience (n = 277) from two nations (Thailand and the United States) self-assessed their communication beliefs on the Global Perceptions of Intergenerational Communication scale. Using communication accommodation theory as a theoretical backdrop, results revealed that, irrespective of culture, young workers perceived older workers as more nonaccommodative (e.g., more negative, more self-centered) than young workers, though young workers still felt more obligation to be polite and "respectfully avoidant" in their communication to older workers. Cross-cultural differences emerged only to the extent that young Americans reported receiving greater accommodation from workers, in general, than did Thais.

AB This study focused on a unique comparison of American, Japanese, and Filipino younger and older adults' intra-and intergenerational communication experiences, and their implications for elder subjective well-being. Hypotheses largely supported and cross-cultural differences notwithstanding, younger adults were more likely to report non-accommodation from, to feel obligated to be polite to, and to avoid older adults than their same-aged peers. Similarly, older adults judged other older adults to be, whilst more accommodating, more nonaccommodating and to require more obligatory respect than younger adults. Both inter-and intragenerational communication experiences were predictive of measures of subjective well-being but, again, with contrastive patterns across cultures. The theoretical relevance of these findings is highlighted.

AB A total of 227 college students from Joliet, Illinois in the USA and Shanghai in the People's Republic of China ( PRC) answered open-ended questions on their perception of being old. Topics also included participant's knowledge about older adults' regular activities, social policies and benefits for senior citizens, the happiest and the most fearful things to older adults, and the things about older adults that they were able to understand the best or the least. More negative ideas of aging and older adults were observed in the PRC data than in the USA data. The USA students' responses displayed individualistic characteristics, whereas the PRC students' answers exhibited collectivistic interconnectedness. These findings gave support to the revised modernization theory and fit well into the theoretical framework of individualistic and collectivistic cultures.

DE Anxiety about aging; Attitudes towards aging; Cultural differences
AB The current study investigated whether beliefs about aging vary by culture, age, and gender. The Lasher and Faulkender (Int. J. Aging Hum. Dev., 37:247-259, 1993) Anxiety about Aging scale was administered to 153 American and 167 South Korean men and women divided into three age groups: young (18-39), middle-aged (40-59), and older (60-91) adults. Significant cultural differences were found for the total anxiety scale and three of the four subscales. Compared to Americans, Koreans portrayed higher overall levels of anxiety about aging, and greater fear of old people, psychological concerns, and concerns over physical appearance. For Koreans, younger adults had greater fear of old people, whereas among Americans, older adults had greater tear of old people. In both cultures, the older adults had greater psychological concerns and fear of losses than did the younger groups, and American women showed more anxiety about aging and concerns over physical appearance than their male counterparts. Results are discussed in relation to aging in different cultural contexts.

TI Age-related stereotypes: A comparison of American and Chinese cultures

AB Background. It is commonly assumed that age-related stereotypes are more positive in East Asian cultures compared to Western cultures. However, research conducted in Western cultures has demonstrated that age-related stereotypes are multidimensional and their valence is content-dependent. Objective: In this study we investigated stereotypes about young and old adults, held by both young and old in the US and in China by focusing on the valence of age stereotypes across two content domains: social/emotional and mental/physical. The goal was to identify whether there were any cultural differences in age-related stereotypes in Chinese and American cultures. Methods: Both young and old Chinese and American participants were asked to describe typical young and typical old people. All responses were then coded for valence (positive/negative/neutral) and for content (mental/physical, social/emotional, other). Descriptors about young and old people were initially analyzed separately; then data were integrated to examine group tendencies to be more positive or negative for each target age group. Results: In both cultures, stereotypes reflected a shift from more positive to increasingly negative views of mental and physical traits as a function of aging. In social and emotional domains, stereotypes regarding old and young adults were relatively neutral, except for a small positive bias found among the young Chinese adults for both target age groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that age-related beliefs regarding typical older adults are similar across East-Asian and Western cultures and that a global positive bias for old age in East-Asia is absent.

SO HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH

   BELIEFS; JAPAN; OLDER
AB To test hypotheses about intra- and intergenerational communication perceptions, non managerial-level bankers (n = 348) in two nations (Thailand and United States) self-assessed their communication beliefs on the Global Perceptions of Intergenerational Communication scale. Communication accommodation theory was used as a theoretical backdrop. Results revealed that older bankers were seen as more nonaccommodating (e.g., more negative, more ordering) than young bankers, though young bankers still felt more obligation to be respectful (e.g., hold back opinions) with older bankers than to their same-age group. In addition, managers were seen as more nonaccommodating than nonmanagers. Cross-cultural findings emerged to the extent that Thai bankers perceived others, in general, as less accommodating (e.g., supportive, helpful) and more nonaccommodating than did their American counterparts; hence, workplace conversations were at least partially viewed as more difficult in Thailand than in the United States. Research on religious and philosophical traditions, cultural convergence and divergence, modernity, and workplace homogenization were invoked to interpret the above findings.

AB There has been little research on the way in which the young respect the elderly, let alone on the issue of crosscultural differences in elder respect. This study, comparing young adults in the United States and young Korean adults in East Asia, explores the specific behavioral forms of elder respect that are cross-culturally equivalent and other forms that are culture specific. Samples of college students were surveyed at universities in the two countries by using the same questionnaire and measurement techniques. An inclusive set of forms of elder respect emerged. Both comparison groups cited care respect, acquiescent respect, linguistic respect, consultative respect, salutatory respect, and precedential respect as the most often practiced and highly important forms. The two groups were dissimilar in other forms. Differences and similarities regarding expressions of various forms and associated cultural traits are discussed. The study provides insights into how younger adults in the two different cultural contexts exhibit elder respect. The typology of the forms presented here can be used to explicate young people's propriety toward the elderly, as well as assess the quality of eldercare and the moral aspect of intergenerational relationships.

TI Attitudes toward aging among Pacific islander health students in Fiji
SO EDUCATIONAL GERONTOLOGY

DT Article
ID OLDER ADULTS
AB The relation between attitudes to aging and cultural values is a complex one. This study contrasts attitudes to aging among Pacific Islander students with attitudes in a comparable Australian sample. Australian society is represented as ageist, whereas Pacific Islander cultures are reported to be age-inclusive. Attitudes were assessed using the Reactions to Ageing Questionnaire, and data also were collected on levels of intimate contact with older people, said to be related to attitude. A comparison of Australian with Pacific Islander data showed no difference in attitude or degree of intimate contact. Within the Pacific Islander sample indigenous Fijians had significantly more positive attitudes than did Indo-Fijians and significantly more intimate contact. Indo-Fijians, but not indigenous Fijians, also were significantly more negative in attitude than Australian students. Educators aiming to incorporate gerontological knowledge and to challenge age-ism in the curriculum should not assume student attitudes are congruent with traditional cultural beliefs. They need to be knowledgeable about and sensitive to differences among various cultural groups within the student population, especially where those students will have the health care of the old in their hands in the future.

AB Grandparent behaviors in the United States and the Republic of China are examined to identify curriculum themes for helping them adjust to their changing role. The 3,286 non-consanguineous subjects included Chinese (n = 751), African Americans (n = 777), Caucasian Americans (n = 1,086), and Mexican Americans (n = 672). Analyses were performed using 1) Generation with three levels (grandparent, parent, and grandchild) and 2) Culture with four levels (Chinese, African American, Caucasian American, and Mexican American). The results revealed significant differences in perceptions about grandparents across cultures as well as between generations within cultures. All three generations reported grandparent strengths and needs. Specific guidelines and curriculum topics are recommended for education to support grandparent development.

ID SPEECH; ADULTS; OLDER
AB This article examines young people's perceptions of their conversations with older people (age 65-85) across nine cultures-five Eastern and four Western. Responses from more than 1,000 participants were entered into a cross-national factor analysis, which revealed four initial factors that underlie perceptions of intergenerational conversations. Elder nonaccommodation was when young participants reported that older people negatively stereotyped the young and did not attend to their communication needs. On the other hand, elder accommodation was when older people were perceived as supportive, attentive and generally encouraging to young people. A third factor was respect/obligation and a fourth factor labeled age-irrelevant positivity described a situation where young people felt conversations with much older people were emotionally positive and satisfying, age did not matter: Examining cross-cultural differences, some East versus West differences were observed, as might be expected, on the basis of simplistic accounts of Eastern collectivism versus Western individualism. However the results challenge commonsense notions of the status of old age in Eastern versus Western cultures. On some dimensions, participants from Korea, Japan, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines appear to have relatively less positive perceptions of their conversations with older people than the Western cultures-the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But there was also evidence of considerable cultural variability, particularly among Eastern cultures-variability that has heretofore all too often been glossed over when global comparisons of East versus West are made. A range of explanations for these cultural differences is explored and implications for older people in these societies are also considered.
